<span class="subhead">SUNRISE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At an uncertain hour before dawn in February
1912, as I lay asleep in my room on the top floor
of a hotel in the town of Mentone, in Southern
France, I was suddenly awakened by the morning
star. It was shining with inquisitive splendour
directly into my left eye. At that quiet
moment, in the last stages of the dying night,
this star seemed enormous. It hung out of the
velvet sky so far that I thought it was going to
fall, and I went out on the balcony of my room
to see it drop. The air was windless and mild,
and, instead of going back to bed, I decided to
stay on the balcony and watch the unfolding
drama of the dawn. For every clear dawn in
this spectacular universe is a magnificent drama,
rising to a superb climax.</p>

<p>The morning stars sang together and I heard
the sons of God shouting for joy. The chief
morning star, the one that had roused me from
slumber, recited a splendid prologue. Then, as
the night paled and the lesser stars withdrew,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
some of the minor characters in the play began
to appear and take their respective parts. The
grey background turned red, then gold. Long
shafts of preliminary light shot up from the
eastern horizon, and then, when the stage was
all set, and the minor characters had completed
their assigned rôles, the curtains suddenly parted
and the sun—the Daystar—the star of the play,
entered with all the panoply of majesty. And
as I stood there and beheld this incomparable
spectacle, and gazed over the mountains, the
meadows and the sea, the words of Shakespeare
came into my mind:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Full many a glorious morning have I seen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kissing with golden face the meadows green.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is a pity that more people do not see the sunrise.
Many do not get up early enough, many
do not stay up late enough. Out of the millions
and millions of men, women and children on this
globe only a comparatively few see the sunrise,
and I dare say there are many respectable persons
who have never seen it at all. One really
should not go through life without seeing the
sun rise at least once, because, even if one is
fortunate enough to be received at last into
heaven, there is one sight wherein this vale of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
tears surpasses the eternal home of the saints.
“There is no night there,” hence there can be no
dawn, no sunrise; it is therefore better to make
the most of it while we can.</p>

<p>As a man feels refreshed after a night’s sleep
and his morning bath, so the sun seems to rise
out of the water like a giant renewed. Milton
gave us an excellent description:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So sinks the daystar in the ocean bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And yet anon repairs his drooping head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flames in the forehead of the morning sky.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Browning, in his poem, <cite>Pippa Passes</cite>, compares
the sunrise to a glass of champagne, a
sparkling wine overflowing the world:</p>

<p class="stanzaheading">DAY!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Faster and more fast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er night’s brim, day boils at last:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boils, pure gold, o’er the cloud-cup’s brim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where spurting and suppressed it lay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For not a froth-flake touched the rim</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of yonder gap in the solid gray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of the eastern cloud, an hour away;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But forth one wavelet, then another, curled.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the whole sunrise, not to be suppressed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rose, reddened, and its seething breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flickered in bounds, grew gold, then overflowed the world.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sunset has a tranquil beauty but to me
there is in it always a tinge of sadness, of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
sadness of farewell, of the approach of darkness.
This mood is expressed in the old hymn which
in my childhood I used to hear so often in
church:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fading, still fading, the last beam is shining,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father in heaven! the day is declining.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Safety and innocence fly with the light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Temptation and danger walk forth with the night.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sorrow may endure for a night, but joy cometh
in the morning, saith the Holy Book. The sunrise
has not only inexpressible majesty and
splendour, but it has the rapture of promise, the
excitement of beginning again. Yesterday
has gone forever, the night is over and we may
start anew. To how many eyes, weary with
wakefulness in the long watches of the night, or
flushed with fever, is the first glimmer of the
dawn welcome. The night makes every fear
and worry worse than the reality, it magnifies
every trivial distress. Mark Twain said the
night brought madness—none of us is quite sane
in the darkness. That particular regret for yesterday
or apprehension for tomorrow that strikes
you like a whiplash in the face at 2:45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
dwindles into an absurdity in the healthy dawn.</p>

<p>Mark Twain, who had expressed the difference
between the night and the morning tragically,
also expressed it humorously. He said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
that when he was lying awake in the middle of
the night he felt like an awful sinner, he hated
himself with a horrible depression and made innumerable
good resolutions; but when at 7:30
he was shaving himself he felt just as cheerful,
healthy and unregenerate as ever.</p>

<p>I am a child of the morning. I love the dawn
and the sunrise. When I was a child I saw the
sunrise from the top of Whiteface and it seemed
to me that I not only saw beauty but heard celestial
music. Ever since reading in George
Moore’s <cite>Evelyn Innes</cite> the nun’s description of
her feelings while listening to Wagner’s Prologue
to <cite>Lohengrin</cite> I myself never hear that
lovely music rising to a tremendous climax without
seeing in imagination what was revealed to
the Sister of Mercy. I am on a mountain top
before dawn; the darkness gives way; the greyness
strengthens, and finally my whole mind and
soul are filled with the increasing light.</p>

<span class="subhead">MOLASSES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before both the word molasses and the thing
it signifies disappear forever from the earth, I
wish to recall its flavour and its importance to
the men and women of my generation. By any
other name it would taste as sweet; it is by no
means yet extinct; but for many years maple
syrup and other commodities have taken its
place on the breakfast table. Yet I was brought
up on molasses. Do you remember, in that marvellous
book, <cite>Helen’s Babies</cite>, when Toddie was
asked what he had in his pantspocket, his devastating
reply to that tragic question? He
calmly answered, “Bread and molasses.”</p>

<p>Well, I was brought up on bread and molasses.
Very often that was all we had for supper. I
well remember, in the sticky days of childhood,
being invited out to supper by my neighbour
Arthur Greene. My table manners were primitive
and my shyness in formal company overwhelming.
When I was ushered into the
Greene dining room not only as the guest of
honour but as the only guest, I felt like Fra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Lippo Lippi in the most august presence in the
universe, only I lacked his impudence to help
me out.</p>

<p>The conditions of life in those days may be
estimated from the fact that the entire formal
supper, even with “company,” consisted wholly
and only of bread, butter and molasses. Around
the festive board sat Mr. Greene, a terrifying
adult who looked as if he had never been young;
Mrs. Greene, tight-lipped and serious; Arthur
Greene, his sister Alice, and his younger
brother, Freddy. As I was company I was
helped first and given a fairly liberal supply of
bread, which I unthinkingly (as though I were
used to such luxuries) spread with butter and
then covered with a thick layer of molasses. Ah,
I was about to learn something.</p>

<p>Mr. Greene turned to his eldest son, and enquired
grimly, “Arthur, which will you have,
bread and butter or bread and molasses?”</p>

<p>The wretched Arthur, looking at my plate,
and believing that his father, in deference to the
“company,” would not quite dare to enforce
what was evidently the regular evening choice,
said, with what I recognised as a pitiful attempt
at careless assurance, “I’ll take both.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t!” countered his father, with a
tone as final as that of a judge in court. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
father was not to be bluffed by the presence of
company; he evidently regarded discipline as
more important than manners. The result was
I felt like a voluptuary, being the only person at
the table who had the luxury of both butter and
molasses. They stuck in my throat; I feel them
choking me still, after an interval of more than
fifty years.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The jug of molasses was on our table at home
at every breakfast and at every supper. The
only variety lay in the fact (do you remember?)
that there were two distinct kinds of molasses—sometimes
we had one, sometimes the other.
There was Porto Rico molasses and there was
New Orleans molasses—brunette and blonde.
The Porto Rico molasses was so dark it was almost
black, and New Orleans molasses was
golden brown.</p>

<p>The worst meal of the three was invariably
supper, and I imagine this was fairly common
among our neighbours. Breakfast was a hearty
repast, starting usually with oatmeal, immediately
followed by beefsteak and potatoes or mutton
chops, sometimes ham and eggs; but usually
beef or chops. It had a glorious coda with
griddle cakes or waffles; and thus stuffed, we
rose from the table like condors from their prey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
and began the day’s work. Dinner at one was a
hearty meal, with soup, roast, vegetables and pie.</p>

<p>Supper consisted of “remainders.” There
was no relish in it, and I remember that very
often my mother, who never complained vocally,
looking at the unattractive spread with lack-lustre
eye, would either speak to our one servant
or would disappear for a moment and return
with a cold potato, which it was clear she distinctly
preferred to the sickening sweetish “preserves”
and cookies or to the bread and molasses
which I myself ate copiously.</p>

<p>However remiss and indifferent and selfish I
may have been in my conduct toward my mother—and
what man does not suffer as he thinks of
this particular feature of the irrecoverable past?—it
does me good to remember that, after I
came to man’s estate, I gave my mother what it
is clear she always and in vain longed for in
earlier years, a good substantial dinner at night.</p>

<p>At breakfast we never put cream and sugar
on our porridge; we always put molasses. Then,
if griddle cakes followed the meat, we once more
had recourse to molasses. And as bread and molasses
was the backbone of the evening meal, you
will see what I mean when I say I swam to manhood
through this viscous sea. In those days
youth was sweet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>The transfer of emphasis from breakfast to
supper is the chief distinguishing change in the
procession of meals as it was and as it became.
It now seems incredible that I once ate large
slabs of steak or big chops at breakfast, but I
certainly did. And supper, which approached
the vanishing point, turned into dinner in later
years.</p>

<p>Many, many years ago we banished the molasses
jug and even the lighter and more patrician
maple syrup ceased to flow at the breakfast
table. I am quite aware that innumerable persons
still eat griddle cakes or waffles and syrup
at the first meal of the day. It is supposed that
the poet-artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti ruined
his health by eating huge portions of ham and
eggs, followed by griddle cakes and molasses,
for breakfast. To me there has always been
something incongruous between syrup and coffee;
they are mutually destructive; one spoils
the taste of the other.</p>

<p>Yet waffles and syrup are a delectable dish;
and I am quite certain that nectar and ambrosia
made no better meal. What to do, then? The
answer is simple. Eat no griddle cakes, no waffles
and no syrup at breakfast; but use these
commodities for dessert at lunch. Then comes
the full flavour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>Many taverns now have hit upon the excellent
idea of serving only two dishes for lunch or
dinner—chicken and waffles. This obviates the
expense of waste, the worry of choice, the time
lost in plans. And what combination could possibly
be better?</p>

<p>One of the happiest recollections of my childhood
is the marvelous hot, crisp waffle lying on
my plate, and my increasing delight as I watched
the molasses filling each square cavity in turn.
As the English poet remarked, “I hate people
who are not serious about their meals.”</p>

<span class="subhead">RESOLUTIONS WHEN I COME TO
BE OLD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>At the age of thirty-two, Jonathan Swift wrote
the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="larger center wspace"><span class="smcap">Resolutions When I Come to Be Old</span></p>

<p>(1) Not to marry a young woman.</p>

<p>(2) Not to keep young company, unless
they desire it.</p>

<p>(3) Not to be peevish, or morose, or suspicious.</p>

<p>(4) Not to scorn present ways, or wits, or
fashions, or men, or war, etc.</p>

<p>(5) Not to be fond of children.</p>

<p>(6) Not to tell the same story over and
over to the same people.</p>

<p>(7) Not to be covetous.</p>

<p>(8) Not to neglect decency or cleanliness,
for fear of falling into nastiness.</p>

<p>(9) Not to be over severe with young people,
but give allowances for their youthful follies
and weaknesses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>(10) Not to be influenced by, or give ear to,
knavish tattling servants, or others.</p>

<p>(11) Not to be too free of advice, or trouble
any but those who desire it.</p>

<p>(12) To desire some good friend to inform
me which of these resolutions I break or neglect,
and wherein, and reform accordingly.</p>

<p>(13) Not to talk too much, nor of myself.</p>

<p>(14) Not to boast of my former beauty, or
strength, or favour with ladies, etc.</p>

<p>(15) Not to hearken to flatteries, nor conceive
I can be beloved by a young woman.</p>

<p>(16) Not to be positive or opinionative.</p>

<p>(17) Not too set for observing all these rules,
for fear I should observe none.</p>
</div>

<p>Swift died at the age of seventy-eight; so far
as I can find out, he lived up to these resolutions
with commendable consistency, except one: his
friend, Dr. Sheridan, was sufficiently indiscreet
to remind him that he was becoming too parsimonious.
Swift resented this criticism, and it
spoiled their friendship.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Although Swift was a pessimist, a cynic and
a misanthrope, these resolutions contain much
wisdom; so much, in fact, that a faithful adherence
to them would save most old men much
suffering and humiliation. I read them first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
when I was a boy and they produced a profound
impression; now that I am in a position where
they fit my case, I believe them to be good medicine,
bitter but wholesome. Swift must have
been bored horribly by many old men, or he must
have observed many old people behaving in a
silly fashion to have written down these rules
with such emphasis.</p>

<p>(1, 2) “Crabbed age and youth cannot live
together,” said Shakespeare; the few exceptions
do no more than prove the rule. Many old
people suffer because they fear that young
people do not desire their company. The solution
is for old people not to allow their happiness
to be dependent on young folks but to have
either company of their own age or intellectual
resources which will make them mentally independent.
I have taught young people for forty
years, and although I am very fond of them, I
prefer the society of people of my own age. If I
were about to take a trip around the world and
could choose either a young or old companion, I
would take the latter.</p>

<p>(3) Good advice for any age, but old persons,
owing to bodily infirmities, are more apt to show
these unlovely characteristics.</p>

<p>(4) This advice was never more needed than
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>(5) I would change this, so it would read
“Not to fondle children.” A man with a bushy
beard can terrify babes.</p>

<p>(6) “I suppose you have all heard this before,
but——” then why tell it?</p>

<p>(7) Especially of the health, vigour, and activity
of younger men.</p>

<p>(8) Swift was himself almost fanatically
clean. It is a disgusting sight to behold old men
who are careless of their clothes and appearance,
as though old age gave one the privilege to appear
in public with the remains of the last meal
on the coat, waistcoat and shirt.</p>

<p>(9) Observe the ways of the dog, and learn
wisdom. The dog allows children to pull his
tail, and bother him in many ways; not because
he likes it, but because he knows children have
no sense. It is useless to expect that children
and young people will think and act like middle-aged
men and women; why be fretful when they
are simply running true to form?</p>

<p>(10) One must remember that slander is of
value only as a self-revelation, never as an accurate
description. The recoil of that particular
gun is greater than the discharge.</p>

<p>(11) Every person loves to give advice and
no one loves to take it. The mother says to the
child, “Now, Freddy, don’t forget to put your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
rubbers on!” to which Freddy replies “Huh!”
Then when Freddy is seventy-six years old, his
granddaughter says, “Now, Grandpa, don’t forget
to put your rubbers on!” to which the grandparent
replies “Huh!” It is a good thing not
to force one’s opinion on others unless they ask
for it; one’s professions and creed will be judged
by one’s life, anyhow.</p>

<p>(12) Ah, that requires the very grace of God.
This kind comes only by prayer and fasting.</p>

<p>(13, 14) Many an old man likes to have
others think that he was in his prime a devil of a
fellow. This particular vanity is hard to eradicate.
Even in the moment of Lear’s heartbreaking
and shattering grief over the death of
his daughter Cordelia he found time to boast of
his former prowess.</p>

<p>(15) I say it not cynically, but in all seriousness:
There is no one who cannot be successfully
flattered, provided the flattery be applied
with some skill. We have at the core such invincible
egotism that we not only listen greedily
to flattery, but, what is far worse, we believe it!</p>

<p>(16) An overbearing, domineering, dogmatic
manner in conversation is abominable in persons
of any age; when old people behave in this
fashion, and it is not resented by the young, it
should really all the more humiliate the old.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
For such acquiescence means that the old man
hasn’t any sense, anyhow.</p>

<p>(17) Know thyself. Ulysses showed his wisdom
in not trusting himself. A Yale undergraduate
left on his door a placard for the janitor
on which was written, “Call me at 7 o’clock;
it is absolutely necessary that I get up at seven.
Make no mistake. Keep knocking until I answer.”
Under this he had written. “Try again
at ten.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HUMOUR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Some one has said that American humour
consists in over-statement and English humour
in understatement. This judgment does not include
everything, but so far as it goes it is not
only accurate, but helps both to explain English
humour and the frequently heard remark that
the English are without it. I suppose one reason
many ill-informed Americans say that Englishmen
have no sense of humour is because the
English do not indulge so commonly as we in
boisterous jocularity, exaggeration, surprise and
burlesque. The average Englishman does not
see why a stranger should accost him with jocosity—many
Englishmen do not see why a
stranger should accost them at all. It is an excellent
plan while travelling in England or anywhere
in Europe never to speak first to an Englishman;
let him open the conversation.</p>

<p>One of the chief differences between the average
Englishman and American is in amiability,
responsiveness, amenity. Americans are probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the most amiable people in the world, the
most happy to respond to an exploratory remark,
the most willing. I dare say it is partly a
matter of climate. Our chronic sunshine makes
us expansive and ebullient.</p>

<p>In any American city on a terrifically hot day,
two hitherto unacquainted men will speak to
each other as they pass on the street, one saying,
“Don’t you wish you had brought your overcoat!”
which harmless jest is returned by the
other with equal affability. If you said that to
an Englishman, he might stare at you blankly,
and perhaps hazard the query, “You mean, of
course, your <em>light</em> overcoat?”</p>

<p>After introduction to a resident Englishman
in Vancouver, British Columbia, at a small dining-table
in a hotel, I remarked gently, “Even
though you are behind the times here in Vancouver,
I do not see why you should advertise
the fact.” “What on earth do you mean?” he
enquired. Then I called his attention to the
dinner-card, on which was printed Vancouver,
B.&nbsp;C. He exclaimed, “But it doesn’t mean that,
you know!” I do not believe he was deficient
in a sense of humour. I had just met him, and
he did not see why a stranger should be sufficiently
intimate to be taken otherwise than
seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p><cite>Punch</cite> is the best of comic papers; it expresses
the genuine original humour of a humorous
folk. I remember seeing there a picture of the
village orchestra, and as the director rapped for
attention, the first violin leaned forward and
asked, “What is the next piece?” and being informed,
replied, “Why I just played that one.”</p>

<p>Woodrow Wilson once told me a story which
illustrates how dangerous it is for anyone to assume
that the English have no sense of humour.</p>

<p>Three Americans were telling anecdotes to illustrate
the English dearth of humour, when
they saw approaching a representative of that
nation. It was agreed that he should then and
there be put to the test. So one of them stopped
him and narrated a side-splitting yarn. The
Englishman received the climax with an impassive
face. The American, delighted, cried,
“Cheer up, old man, you’ll laugh at that next
summer.” “No,” said the Briton, gravely, “I
think not.” “Why not?” “Because I laughed
at that <em>last</em> summer.”</p>

<p>The humour of English political campaign
speeches at its best, is unsurpassed. When the
late John Morley had finished an oration by requesting
his hearers to vote for him, one man
jumped up and shouted angrily, “I’d rather vote
for the devil.” “Quite so,” returned the unruffled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
statesman; “but in case your friend declines
to run, may I not then count upon your support?”</p>

<p>A perfect retort was made to the great and
genial Thackeray, on the one occasion when he
ran for Parliament. He met his opponent, Edward
Cardwell, during the course of the campaign,
and after a pleasant exchange of civilities,
Thackeray remarked, “Well, I hope it will be a
good fight, and may the best man win.” “Oh, I
hope not,” said Cardwell.</p>

<p>The English are the only people who seem to
be amused by attacks on their country; does this
show a sense of superiority that increases the
rage of the critic? Or is it that their sense of
humour extends even to that most sacred of all
modern religions, the religion of nationalism?</p>

<p>The Irish are supposed to excel the English in
humour; but it is a fact that English audiences
in the theatre are diverted by sarcastic attacks on
the English, whereas it is physically dangerous
to try a similar method on an Irish audience.
The Irish patriot, Katharine Tynan, said that if
she could only once succeed in enraging the English,
she would feel that something might be
accomplished. “But,” said she, “I tell them at
dinner parties the most outrageous things that
are said against their country, and they all roar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
with laughter.” Undue sensitiveness to attack
betrays a feeling of insecurity.</p>

<p>Typical American humour is not subtle and
ironical; it is made up largely of exaggeration
and surprise—Mark Twain was a master of ending
a sentence with something unexpected. “I
admire the serene assurance of those who have
religious faith. It is wonderful to observe the
calm confidence of a Christian with four aces.”</p>

<p>Anthony Hope, in his recent book <cite>Memories
and Notes</cite>, says that when Mark made his first
dinner speech in London before a distinguished
audience, there was intense curiosity as to what
he would say. He began with an unusually slow
drawl. “Homer is dead, Shakespeare is dead—and
I am far from well.”</p>

<p>Another true story (which I took pains to
verify) happened during the early days of his
married life, which synchronised with the beginnings
of the telephone. Incredible as it may
seem, Mrs. Clemens had not heard Mark swear,
for during the engagement he had managed by
superhuman efforts to refrain from what he
called that noble art, and she did not dream of
his oral efficiency. But one day, thinking he
was alone, he started to use the telephone.
(The Paris <cite>Figaro</cite> says that to get your telephone
connexion is not an achievement; it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
career.) Mark, having difficulties, poured out a
torrent of river profanity. He looked around
and there was his wife, frozen with horror.</p>

<p>But she had heard that the way to cure a husband
of profanity was for the wife to swear in
his presence. So, in a cold, artificial voice, she
said, “Blankety-Blank-Blank.” Mark cried,
“Darling, you know the words, but you don’t
know the tune!”</p>

<p>Mark had a way of combining philosophy and
humour. This is the gospel according to Mark
Twain. “Live so that when you die even the
undertaker will be sorry.”</p>

<span class="subhead">A PAIR OF SOCKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One fine afternoon I was walking along Fifth
Avenue, when I remembered that it was necessary
to buy a pair of socks. Why I wished to
buy only one pair is unimportant. I turned into
the first sock shop that caught my eye, and a
boy clerk who could not have been more than
seventeen years old came forward. “What can
I do for you, sir?” “I wish to buy a pair of
socks.” His eyes glowed. There was a note of
passion in his voice. “Did you know that you
had come into the finest place in the world to
buy socks?” I had not been aware of that, as
my entrance had been accidental. “Come with
me,” said the boy, ecstatically. I followed him
to the rear of the shop, and he began to haul
down from the shelves box after box, displaying
their contents for my delectation.</p>

<p>“Hold on, lad, I am going to buy only one
pair!” “I know that,” said he, “but I want you
to see how marvellously beautiful these are.
Aren’t they wonderful!” There was on his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
an expression of solemn and holy rapture, as if
he were revealing to me the mysteries of his religion.
I became far more interested in him
than in the socks. I looked at him in amazement.
“My friend,” said I, “if you can keep
this up, if this is not merely the enthusiasm that
comes from novelty, from having a new job, if
you can keep up this zeal and excitement day
after day, in ten years you will own every sock
in the United States.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>My amazement at his pride and joy in salesmanship
will be easily understood by all who
read this article. In many shops the customer
has to wait for some one to wait upon him. And
when finally some clerk does deign to notice you,
you are made to feel as if you were interrupting
him. Either he is absorbed in profound thought
in which he hates to be disturbed or he is skylarking
with a girl clerk and you feel like apologising
for thrusting yourself into such intimacy.</p>

<p>He displays no interest either in you or in the
goods he is paid to sell. Yet possibly that very
clerk who is now so apathetic began his career
with hope and enthusiasm. The daily grind
was too much for him; the novelty wore off; his
only pleasures were found outside of working
hours. He became a mechanical, not an inspired,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
salesman. After being mechanical, he
became incompetent; then he saw younger clerks
who had more zest in their work, promoted over
him. He became sour and nourished a grievance.
That was the last stage. His usefulness
was over.</p>

<p>I have observed this melancholy decline in the
lives of so many men in so many occupations
that I have come to the conclusion that the surest
road to failure is to do things mechanically.
There is, for example, no greater literature in
the world than the Bible and no more exciting
subject than religion. Yet I have heard many
ministers of the gospel read the Bible in their
churches with no interest and no emphasis,
whereas they ought to read it as if they had just
received it by wireless from Almighty God. I
have heard hundreds of sermons preached mechanically,
with no more appeal than if the
speaker were a parrot. There are many
teachers in schools and colleges who seem duller
than the dullest of their pupils; they go through
the motions of teaching, but they are as impersonal
as a telephone.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In reading that remarkable book, <cite>The Americanization
of Edward Bok</cite>, I was impressed by
what he said of competition in business. Beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
as a very young man in a certain occupation,
he had expected to encounter the severest
competition. As a matter of fact, he met no
competition at all, and found that success was
the easiest thing in the world, if one provided
the conditions necessary for it.</p>

<p>He worked along with a number of other
young men in the business. He was the only
one who ever got to the place ahead of time. At
the noon hour at lunch the other youngsters
never on a single occasion mentioned the business
in which they were engaged. They talked
of their girls, or of athletic sports, or of various
dissipations. He was the only man who ever
remained after business hours, and he was convinced
that he was the only one who ever occupied
his mind with the business during his evenings.</p>

<p>He rose above the others with consummate
ease, and for two obvious reasons: First, he made
himself indispensable; second, he found his
chief pleasure in his work, not in the dissipations
outside of it.</p>

<p>It is simple enough for any one to be attracted
by the novelty of a new job. The real difficulty
is to keep up that initial enthusiasm every day
of one’s life, to go to work every morning with
zest and excitement. I believe that a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
should live every day as if that day were his first
and his last day on earth.</p>

<p>Every person needs some relaxation, some
recreation; but a man’s chief happiness should
not lie outside his daily work, but in it. The
chief difference between the happiness of childhood
and the happiness of maturity is that the
child’s happiness is dependent on something different
from the daily routine—a picnic, an excursion,
a break of some kind. But to the right
sort of men and women happiness is found in
the routine itself, not in departures from it. Instead
of hoping for a change, one hopes there
will be no change, that one will have sufficient
health to continue in one’s chosen occupation.
The child has pleasures; the man has happiness.
But unfortunately some men remain children all
their lives.</p>

<span class="subhead">AN INSPIRING CEMETERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Americans should not leave Florence without
spending some reflective hours in the so-called
Protestant cemetery. The grave of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning is adorned with a beautiful
marble tomb designed by the famous artist
Leighton, and the only inscription thereupon is
“E.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;B. Ob. 1861.”</p>

<p>Not far away lies the famous poet, Walter
Savage Landor, who died in 1864 at the age of
eighty-nine. His grave is covered with a flat
stone. Here is a poem he wrote about it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Twenty years hence, though it may hap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I be called to take a nap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a cool cell where thunder clap</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Was never heard,</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There breathe but o’er my arch of grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A not too sadly sigh’d “Alas!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I shall catch ere you can pass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">That wingéd word.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The last time I was in Florence I bent over his
grave and with deliberate emphasis I whispered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
“Alas!” I do not know whether he heard me
or not.</p>

<p>Robert and Elizabeth Browning made the
poet’s later years as happy as was possible for
one of his temperament; they secured a villa for
him, furnished it, hired servants and did what
they could. He was wildly irascible, and if he
did not like a meal that was served, he grabbed
the table-cloth, and twitched all the food and
dishes on to the floor. All his life he was a fighting
man, which makes the beautiful Farewell he
wrote somewhat incongruous.</p>

<p class="stanzaheading">THE LAST FRUIT OF AN OLD TREE</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I strove with none; for none was worth my strife.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nature I loved, and next to Nature, Art;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I warmed both hands before the fire of life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It sinks and I am ready to depart.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In order to fit my own feelings, I should have
to make some slight changes in his poem, so that
the amended version would read as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I strove with none. I always hated strife.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nature I loved, and God and Man and Art.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I warmed both hands before the fire of life;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">It sinks—yet I’m not ready to depart.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Landor was sometimes in a more jovial mood,
as in his invitation to Tennyson:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I entreat you, Alfred Tennyson,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Good, but better when you share it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tho’ ’tis only a small bin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s a stock of it within.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as sure as I’m a rhymer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Half a butt of Rudesheimer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come; among the sons of men is one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Welcomer than Alfred Tennyson?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Along the path leading to Mrs. Browning’s
tomb is the grave of the English poet, Arthur
Hugh Clough (pronounced Cluff), who crossed
the ocean with Thackeray and James Russell
Lowell and whose most famous poem is <cite>Say Not
the Struggle Nought Availeth</cite>. He died in 1861
the same year as Mrs. Browning, at the early age
of 42. He was a distinguished scholar of Balliol
college, Oxford. He expressed in his poems the
doubts and struggles that have afflicted so many
honest and candid minds.</p>

<p>In addition to the three great English poets
who are buried in this cemetery, two famous
Americans lie there, Richard Hildreth and Theodore
Parker. When I was an undergraduate, I
asked Prof. W.&nbsp;G. Sumner what was the best History
of the United States that had ever been
written; he answered gruffly and without a word
of qualification, “Hildreth’s!” Accordingly, I
read every word of the six volumes. Many years
later I had the unique pleasure of telling Sumner
something he had not known; I told him I had
done homage at Hildreth’s grave in Florence,
and he was surprised to learn that the historian
was buried there. If any one believes that the
contemporary custom of “debunking” historical
characters is new, he should read Hildreth’s
Preface to his History.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Of centennial sermons and Fourth of July orations,
whether professedly such or in the guise of
history, there are more than enough. It is due to our
fathers and ourselves, it is due to truth and philosophy,
to present for once, on the historic stage,
the founders of our American nation unbedaubed
with patriotic rouge, wrapped up in no fine-spun
cloaks of excuses and apology, without stilts, buskins,
tinsel, or bedizenment, in their own proper persons.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ANCIENT FOOTBALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Attacks on the American game of football are
often more sensational than the game itself.
Some volley out statistics of injuries, in which
we see the names of persons “crippled for life”
whom we know to be unlike their biographers in
that they are both well and cheerful; others
descant wildly on the evils of betting and the
drunkenness attendant upon a great match;
others deplore the time and attention robbed
from study; some believe the rivalry of two
strong teams causes prolonged bitterness and
hatred; some regard the intense earnestness of
training as both silly and harmful; some assert
that the players on the field behave like ruffians,
and some, like the old Puritans, hate the game
not because they really think it wicked but because
they secretly hate to see eighty thousand
people out for a holiday.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that football, like every
other sport and recreation, is open to many serious
objections. Certain players are every year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
killed and wounded, though the mortality is
nothing like so great as that resulting from automobile
accidents and week-end celebrations. It
is certainly true that betting and dissipation accompany
the game; it is true that many young
men sit on the benches, cheering and singing,
when they might be studying in the seclusion of
their rooms.</p>

<p>It is true that the American spirit—always
ambitious of success—makes every member of a
university team train with an earnestness that
seems tragi-comic to the nonathletic observer.
But the immense advantages of this most robust
of all sports outweigh all its attendant evils.
For football is much more than a contest of animal
vigour; in the language of Professor Stagg,
who was a moralist before he was an athlete,
“Football surpasses every other game in its demand
for a high combination of physical, mental
and moral qualities.”</p>

<p>This article, however, is not written for the
purpose of defending modern football but rather
to show that the game thus far has not only
flourished in spite of attacks but that there has
been a tremendous rise in its respectability since
the days of Queen Elizabeth. I cannot just
now remember anything on which the Puritans
and the playwrights were then agreed, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
their opinion of football. What Shakespeare
thought of it may be seen in the epithet which
Kent applies to one of the most odious characters
in <cite>King Lear</cite>. Tripping up Oswald, he calls
him “you base football player.”</p>

<p>Modern legislators must rejoice at finding that
they have plenty of precedents for legal prohibition
of the game. In 1424 we find “The King
forbiddes that na man play fut ball under payne
of iiiid.” Sir Thomas Elyot remarked, in 1531,
“Foote balle, wherin is nothing but beastly furie
and exstreme violence.”</p>

<p>If in Elizabethan days the dramatists, who
were not noted for their piety, attacked football,
what shall we expect from the Puritans? The
most circumstantial indictment of the game
came from a Puritan of Puritans, Philip Stubbs.
In his <cite>Anatomie of Abuses</cite> (1583) he thus denounces
the sport:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For as concerning football playing, I protest vnto
you it may rather be called a frieendly kinde of fight,
then a play of recreation; A bloody and murthering
practise, then a felowly sporte or pastime. For dooth
not euery one lye in waight for his Aduersarie, seeking
to ouerthrowe him &amp; to picke him on his nose,
though it be vppon hard stones? In ditch or dale, in
valley or hil, or what place soeuer it be, hee careth
not, so he haue him down. And he that can serue the
most of this fashion, he is counted the only felow,
and who but he? so that by this meanes, sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
their necks are broken, sometimes their backs, sometime
their legs, sometime their armes; sometime one
part thrust out of ioynt, sometime another. Sometime
the noses gush out with blood, sometime their
eyes start out; and sometimes hurt in one place, sometimes
in another. But whosoeuer scapeth away the
best, goeth not scotfree, but is either sore wounded,
craised, and bruiseed so as he dyeth of it, or else
scapeth very hardly, and no meruaile, for they haue
the sleights to meet one betwixt two, to dash him
against the hart with their elbowes, to hit him vnder
the short ribbes with their griped fists, and with their
knees to catch him vpon the hip, and to pick him on
his neck, with a hundred such murdering deuices; and
hereof groweth enuie, malice, rancour, cholor, hatred,
displeasure, enemities, and what not els; and sometimes
fighting, brawling, contention, quarrel picking,
murther, homicide, and great effusion of blood, as
experience dayely teacheth.</p>
</div>

<p>In the attack just quoted the most interesting
thing to the modern reader is that precisely the
same objections were made to the game as we
hear today.</p>

<p>In the robust days of Queen Bess football was
regarded as low and vulgar; it received the denunciation
of the Church and the more potent
frown of fashionable society. Today at a great
university match prominent clergymen are seen
even on the sidelines; the bleachers bloom with
lovely women, and in a conspicuous place stands
the President of the United States.</p>

<span class="subhead">RIVERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On the first of several agreeable visits to Carbondale
in southern Illinois, whither I went to
address the best of all audiences—public school
teachers—I enquired of the superintendent, Mr.
Black, as to the precise distance that separated
us from the Mississippi river. I told him I loved
all rivers, and this one particularly. I had seen
it at St. Paul, at St. Louis, Memphis and New
Orleans. I wished to see it far from the noise,
smoke and artificiality of cities. I wished to see
it naked. He informed me that he was the proud
owner of an open Ford car, that the Father of
Waters was only eighteen miles away, and that
he would lead me to it that very afternoon.</p>

<p>It was a charming day in early spring. I stood
on the bank of the mighty Mississippi. There
was no town, settlement, not even a house in
sight. The glorious old river at this point was
one mile wide, fifty feet deep, and running seven
miles an hour. Away up stream on the Missouri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
side the trees were in the living green of April;
and the flood came rolling along in silent majesty.</p>

<p>I thought of the old seventeenth century
poet, Denham, and what he said of another
river.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, could I flow like thee, and make thy stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My great example, as it is my theme!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strong without rage, without o’erflowing full.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Every river has a fascination for me, because
it is alive. In a green landscape, or in a rocky
gorge, or in the midst of a forest, or dividing a
city, it gives to every scene the element of life.
Living waters flowing through meadows, over
sands, between mountains are always moving,
progressing, going somewhere. If one
climbs a hill, and looks off on a vast expanse of
fresh woods and pastures new, and suddenly sees
a river, the heart leaps up with recognition.</p>

<p>Looking at a map—the expressive face of the
world—I have often wished to follow the course
of various rivers. I should like to go down the
Amazon, the Yukon, and the Yangtze. Each
river has a personality. Most rivers that empty
into the ocean are tidal; their current is pushed
backward by the incoming sea. But the Amazon
is so mighty that it overcomes the force of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the tide and transforms the ocean into fresh
water. Unless voyagers and novelists are abandoned
liars, one can be off the coast of South
America, out of sight of land and dip up fresh
water, so tremendous and far-reaching is the
shove of the Amazon. Its mouth is so wide that
one could place in it crosswise, the whole Hudson
river from New York to Albany, without touching
either shore.</p>

<p>The personality of the Mississippi is striking.
In the greatest of all Mark Twain’s contributions
to literature, the first volume of <cite>Life on the
Mississippi</cite>, he gives us marvellous impressions
of the character and behaviour of the stream.
And in one of the foremost novels of our time,
Charles Stewart’s <cite>Partners of Providence</cite>, the
peculiar habits and whims of the Mississippi are
set forth. It quite rightly regards itself as socially
superior to the Missouri; so much so, in
fact, that for some time after the entrance of the
Missouri into its waters, the Mississippi positively
refuses to have anything to do with the interloper.</p>

<p>In the old days “before the war” (our war),
luxurious passenger steamers plied from St.
Louis to New Orleans; and I understand that,
after the lapse of many years, we are to have
similar vessels. This is as it should be; an immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
amount of American literature and history,
from De Soto to Edna Ferber, is associated
with this river, and the opportunity of travelling
on it should be given to all Americans. I have
not yet abandoned my youthful dream of travelling
on the Mississippi from St. Paul to St. Louis,
and from St. Louis to New Orleans.</p>

<p>I never miss a good chance for a river voyage.
One has the element of adventure as one rounds
the next bend. I have been on the rivers of
southern Florida, I have been on the Savannah
river in Georgia, and the last time I was at Vanderbilt
university, in Nashville, friends gave me
a memorable excursion on the Cumberland.
One of the most interesting of all inland voyages
in the United States is to take the steamer from
Norfolk to Richmond on the James. From
seven in the morning to eight at night it is a panorama
of American history.</p>

<p>The word river occurs many times in the Bible,
and think of the part played in the story of mankind
by the Euphrates, the Nile, and the Jordan!
The Bible begins and ends with a river. In the
second chapter of Genesis, we read “And a river
went out of Eden to water the garden,” a lovely
spectacle, for Paradise would never have been
complete without a river. In the last chapter of
Revelation, we read, “And he showed me a pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding
out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.”</p>

<p>It is curious when the Bible speaks of the
River of Life—“on either side of the river there
was the tree of life”—that the idea should persist
of the River of Death. This is a heathen
and pagan idea and has no place in Jewish or
Christian thought. Many people speak solemnly
of crossing the river—they get the notion
either from Greek mythology or from Bunyan’s
<cite>Pilgrim’s Progress</cite>, or metaphorically, from the
Promised Land lying on the other side of the
Jordan.</p>

<p>In reality the Bible tells us that both the
earthly and the heavenly Paradise had a river to
refresh and gladden the people.</p>

<p>Without sermonising too grossly, we may say
that a river is like a human life. The source is
often obscure and humble, then a tiny stream,
then growing bigger and more important (the
widening of influence), then flowing tranquilly
(prosperous, happy days), then getting into
sand flats, hardly moving (serious illness), then
roaring tempestuously in rapids (times of excitement
and adventure), yet going on, somehow
and somewhere.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they always arrive ultimately at
the same destination—the mysterious open sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
leaving narrow circumstances for a deeper and
greater existence.</p>

<p>And even those streams that seem to perish
without fulfilling their destiny, are in their subsequent
influence like the lives of obscurely good
men. Some travellers in a desert came to a bit
of green meadow where a river once had been.</p>

<span class="subhead">ONE DAY AT A TIME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>On a certain morning in the year 1900 I called
on President Eliot at his office in Harvard University.
He was in a gracious mood and we
talked of many things. As I rose to leave I said
I hoped I might always have the privilege of
calling on him whenever I came to Cambridge.
He remarked gravely (in every sense of that
word): “The next time you come I may not be
here.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Are you going to resign?”
“Resign? Certainly not. But, remember,
I am sixty-six years old.” The only answer
to that was a laugh, which I provided spontaneously.</p>

<p>Now if the distinguished president of Harvard
had known then that twenty-five years after this
interview, he would be in the full possession of
his physical and mental faculties, even though
he had ceased to possess the Harvard one, he
would have wasted not a single moment on the
thought of his approaching death. And if gold
rusts, what shall iron do?</p>

<p>In the eighteenth century, the poet Young was
an intimate friend of the novelist Richardson
and their correspondence has a certain mortuary
interest. For Young’s letters are as gloomy as
his verses; they are largely taken up with predicting
his own speedy death, which, however,
Richardson awaited in vain, as the aged poet
survived him. In his own last moments Richardson
may have felt something akin to resentment
at having wasted his sympathy on one
who would attend his funeral.</p>

<p>We look backward too much and we look forward
too much. Thus we miss the passing moment.
In our regrets and apprehensions, we
miss the only eternity of which man can be absolutely
sure, the eternal Present. For it is always
NOW.</p>

<p>I was deeply impressed in reading Dr. Cushing’s
admirable biography of Sir William Osler,
to see that the physician and philosopher laid
the greatest stress on living one day at a time.
That was his summary of the art of living, for
all those who wished to accomplish as much as
possible, and retain their peace of mind: Live
one day at a time.</p>

<p>I remember, when I was twenty years old, I
wasted many good hours in speculating on what
I should do after graduation from college, which
event was two years ahead. An old man told
me not to give it a moment’s thought: “You cannot
decide what to do till the emergency comes.”
Meanwhile there was the daily work. The best
way to prepare for the future was to do that well,
rather than waste one’s energies on idle worry.</p>

<p>There are always gloomy prophets who cannot
enjoy the present moment, because they are
so sure trouble is coming. The winter of 1917–1918<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
was the coldest in my recollection; and
many said, “Well, the climate is changing and
we must not expect any mild winters.” Then
came the winter of 1918–1919, which was the
mildest in my recollection. And how distinctly
I recall conversations like the following. Along
about Christmastide, I would say, “What a
beautiful winter!” and in every instance, without
a single exception, I got the reply, “Just
wait. We’ll catch it later.” Then when the
weather continued sweet all through January, I
made the same remark to different individuals,
and always got a warning for my pains. But the
evil came not at all. My friends had determined
to be miserable. They could not enjoy a lovely
mild season, for in its loveliness they shook with
the chill of apprehension.</p>

<p>The fear of life is the favourite disease of the
twentieth century. Too many people are
afraid of tomorrow—their happiness is poisoned
by a phantom. Many are afraid of old age, forgetting
that even if they should lose their bodily
vigour, weakness itself may minister to the development
of the mind and spirit. In the words
of the aged poet Waller,</p>

<p>Let the scientists worry about our origin—slime,
monkeys, what not; let the prophets
worry about our future—“the decline of western
civilisations,” and what not. Some people are
alarmed because in nine thousand billion years
the sun’s fuel may give out. Instead of chagrin
over our past, and alarm over our future, suppose
we consider our opportunity.</p>

<p>Listen to Emerson: “Write it on your heart
that every day is the best day in the year. No
man has earned anything rightly until he knows
that every day is doomsday. Today is a king in
disguise. Today always looks mean to the
thoughtless, in the face of a uniform experience
that all good and great and happy actions are
made up precisely of these blank todays. Let
us not be deceived, let us unmask the king as he
passes.”</p>

<p>Our Lord, in his daily conversations, was always
drawing the attention of his listeners away
from vague speculations, to the present moment
and the present opportunity. To such absurd
enquiries as, “Whose wife shall she be in
heaven?” he said, “God is not the God of the
dead, but of the living.” To the man who said
that he must postpone action until he had attended
a funeral, the Master replied crisply, “Let
the dead bury the dead and come and follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
me.” And after an enumeration of the various
worries about the future with which men and
women torment their minds, he said, “Take no
thought for the morrow.” Do not worry about
the future. He added, significantly, that if we
are determined to look for trouble, we can find
it today without waiting for tomorrow.</p>

<span class="subhead">CITY AND COUNTRY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is generally assumed that the country is
more romantic, more poetical than the city; but
it would not be so easy to prove this, if one were
put to the test. “God made the country and
man made the town,” said William Cowper,
which meant simply that he preferred rural life.
It is rather amusing to consider that in our age,
which is so often called the age of machines, and
when many people are afraid that simplicity and
individuality will be lost, country places, mountain
scenery, and the wilderness are more popular
than ever before.</p>

<p>Now there are fashions in outdoor nature just
as there are fashions in clothes. Today everyone
must profess a love for mountains whether
one really likes them or not; for mountains are
very fashionable. Switzerland is the playground
of the world; and the inhabitants make
a larger income off their barren rocks than most
communities make off fertile and productive
plains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>But it is only within two hundred years that
mountains have been generally admired. Before
that time they were usually regarded as
ugly excrescences, both disagreeable and dangerous;
and at the best they were no more to be
regarded as objects of beauty than pimples.
English gentlemen who made the Grand Tour in
the seventeenth century thought the Alps were
disgusting; they were a monstrous and abominable
barrier that must be crossed before the
traveller could reach the smiling landscape of
Italy.</p>

<p>When Addison wrote home from his travels in
1701, he said that he had had “a very troublesome
journey over the Alps. My head is still
giddy with mountains and precipices; and you
can’t imagine how much I am pleased with the
sight of a plain!” Such a remark would injure
the reputation of a modern pilgrim; but Addison
made it in perfect good faith, and with no apology.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of our contemporary love of
wild scenery is owing to the comfortable circumstances
in which we behold it; transportation,
tunnels, fine hotels, luxuries of every description
enable us to view mountains in security and
serenity; but if we had to pass over them in
acute discomfort and in constant danger, our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
attitude might be more like Addison’s. This
by no means explains why the once “horrid” has
become fashionable; but it helps to explain the
modern love of wild scenery.</p>

<p>Had Addison been told that two centuries
later people would build hotels on the edge of
Alpine precipices, he would have dismissed the
idea as a silly dream; no one would put a roadhouse
there. “But, Mr. Addison, I am not talking
of roadhouses. These hotels are not on the
way to something else; they are not a means,
they are an end. People will travel three thousand
miles from California to New York, sail
three thousand miles from New York to Europe
just to spend the summer in a mountain hotel,
where it costs twenty dollars a day—” he would
have regarded the coming generation as idiotic.</p>

<p>It was Thomas Gray, author of the <cite>Elegy</cite>, who
was one of the first English travellers to see the
beauty of the Alps, and it was he therefore who
is originally responsible for making them fashionable.
He and Horace Walpole drove over
the mountains in a chaise, and Gray wrote to his
friend West, “Not a precipice, not a torrent, not
a cliff, but is pregnant with religion and poetry.
There are certain scenes that would awe an atheist
into belief.” This was a new note in literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>It is my belief that mountains and wild scenery
are more appreciated today by citified folk
who love them for the change and novelty than
they are by those who are forced to live among
them all the time. When I was young, I walked
with three of my college mates from New Haven
to the White Mountains; it was a fine expedition,
and took us some three weeks. I remember
toward twilight on a certain day we entered
a gorge and passed through into a place surrounded
by austere mountains.</p>

<p>A farmer addressed us: “Where do you boys
come from?”</p>

<p>“Connecticut.”</p>

<p>He slowly and solemnly repeated the word
CONN-ECT-ICUT—as though he were saying
MESOPOTAMIA, and added, “My, I’d like to
see Connecticut.”</p>

<p>We told him it was not so very remarkable.</p>

<p>“We have no such mountains as these in Connecticut.”</p>

<p>He replied, “Oh, damn these mountains! I’m
sick of the sight of them.” And it appeared that
he had never been out of that valley.</p>

<p>I spend a quarter of my life in the country,
and love it, but if I had to choose between living
all my life in the country or in a large city, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
should choose the city immediately. And I believe
this is true of most people.</p>

<p>A crowd of unemployed some years ago stood
in line at the Detroit city hall. A man came up
and offered every one in turn good wages, good
food, a good place to sleep, and plenty of fresh
air, if he would take for the summer a job on a
farm. Every one of the men laughed at him.
Some of us more fortunate folks are irritated by
this, for in America everybody thinks that everybody
else ought to be a farmer. But the truth
is that man does not live by bread alone. People
do not live in order to live—merely for healthy
surroundings and good food. They want excitement,
they want something interesting.
Who can blame them? Don’t you feel that way
yourself?</p>

<p>We should all contribute to the Fresh Air
Funds, because little children of the slums ought
to have a chance to see unimpaired nature. But
very few of the children would be willing to stay
there, and in some cases after a few days they are
homesick for their native filth. The city is one
continuous theatre, admission free; the street is
the best playground in this world. There is a
fire, a street fight, the appearance of policemen,
an arrest, an automobile accident—all the day
and all the night, “something doing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>Thus it is not at all strange that the majority
prefer the crowded conditions of the slums to the
fresh air of the country; for other things being
equal, isn’t that about the way we all feel?</p>

<span class="subhead">AGE BEFORE BEAUTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>This frequently-heard statement is a left-handed
compliment; like many conventional
tributes, it carries a smirk rather than a smile.
Underneath the formal and hollow homage paid
to the ancient the preference is of course elsewhere.
It is somewhat like the so-called complimentary
vote given to the “favourite son” at
a political convention, which no one takes seriously,
not even the son. Nothing would perhaps
more shockingly disconcert the ballot-casters
than to have their candidate receive other
than local support.</p>

<p>In the expression Age Before Beauty, it is implied
that the two are incompatible; you cannot
have both. Yet upon a little reflexion it will
appear that the vast majority of objects that receive
human attention become more and more
beautiful with the accumulation of years. I can
think of only two classes of things that are more
beautiful in their early than in their later existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

<p>I refer first to all varieties of animal life, including
man; second to all objects whose main
purpose is practical usefulness.</p>

<p>It ought to be obvious that kittens, puppies,
baby lions, boys and girls are fairer to look upon
than aged cats, rheumatic hounds, toothless
lions, decrepit men, and time-worn harridans—such
as guide you to your seat in the Paris
theatres. It is true that the ecclesiastical poet,
Dr. Donne, made a couplet comforting to some
whose youth is only a memory.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor Spring nor Summer’s beauty hath such grace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As I have seen in one autumnal face.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But you will observe he said “one” not many;
and he had in mind not a number of charming
old ladies, but just one. No doubt there are a
sufficient number of exceptions to give added
stability to the rule.</p>

<p>Browning said the reason why youth is so fair
is that it would be intolerable without it; beauty
is youth’s only asset. Nature makes boys and
girls lovely to look upon so they can be tolerated
until they acquire some sense. As soon as they
are able to pull their weight in the work of the
world and in the intellectual clearing-house of
society, then grace and beauty depart. Thus
mature people who have no brains and no sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
are the last word in futility. They are as ridiculous
as old apple-blossoms which for some reason
never went into fruition.</p>

<p>The second class of objects which are beautiful
only in youth are those which are built
mainly for use. The purpose of an automobile
is to go. A motor car one year old is better than
when ten years old; it is also more attractive to
the eye. I suppose Americans are the only
people in the world who often buy new cars. If
an Englishman has a car that carries him satisfactorily,
he keeps it; the American “turns it in.”
There is no more striking evidence of the “prosperity”
of the American people than the twofold
fact of the abundance of new cars, and also—amazing,
when you think about it—that the
tremendously efficient T-model Ford was not
sufficiently lovely to pay for its continued manufacture.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, the number of my acquaintances
whose fathers owned a horse and
carriage could be counted on the fingers of one
hand, like those who now own a steam yacht;
the fact that the old Ford car is not “good
enough” indicates how times have changed.
For the proper epitaph for the T-model we
should have to adapt the words of Shakespeare,
which he put into a funeral oration:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But yesterday the Ford T-model might</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Have stood against the world; now lies it there,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And none so poor to do it reverence.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Beauty and newness are inseparable in the
case of bicycles, grocery-wagons, machinery,
steamboats, factory buildings, flannel shirts,
shoes, typewriters, trousers, socks; with all of
these articles age means ugliness. In mechanical
objects there is no charm in the accumulation
of years.</p>

<p>But cathedrals, trees, mountains, castles,
manor-houses, college lawns, violins, with the
increase of age take on not only dignity but
beauty. A thirteenth-century cathedral is more
lovely than a glossy new church; an old tree is
more beautiful than any sapling; the ancient
turf in the quads of Oxford is fairer to behold
than the graded front yard of a new house in
Dakota.</p>

<p>Why do hundreds of thousands of Americans
travel gladly in Europe every summer? Mainly
for one thing. It is that their Yankee eyes may
have the sensation of seeing objects which the
wear of centuries has made beautiful. Many
of us Americans have had the natural habit of
associating beauty with newness; the new hat,
the new clothes, the new motor car, the new
stadium. It is worth while to discover that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
there are innumerable objects where age, instead
of being a humiliation and a “depreciation,” is
not only an asset, but a thing of beauty whose
loveliness increases.</p>

<p>Boys and girls brought up in the slums naturally
regard newness as essential to beauty and
worth; the Fresh Air Fund should, if possible,
take them not only to fresh woods and fields, but
illuminate their minds with the sight of buildings
whose age, instead of tarnishing, has made
them surpassingly attractive. Henry James, in
one of his novels, has a boy from the London
slums entertained overnight in an English country
house. This is what he saw as he looked out
of his window in the early morning.</p>

<p>“He had never in his life been in the country—the
real country, as he called it, the country
which was not the mere ravelled fringe of London—and
there entered through his open casement
the breath of a world enchantingly new
and after his feverish hours unspeakably refreshing;
a sense of sweet sunny air and mingled
odours, all strangely pure and agreeable, and of
a musical silence that consisted for the greater
part of the voices of many birds. There were
tall quiet trees near by and afar off and everywhere....
There was something in the way
the grey walls rose from the green lawn that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
brought tears to his eyes; the spectacle of long
duration unassociated with some sordid infirmity
or poverty was new to him; he had lived with
people among whom old age meant for the most
part a grudged and degraded survival. In the
favored resistance of Medley was a serenity of
success, an accumulation of dignity and honour.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_63">XII<br>

<span class="subhead">CHURCH UNITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I have in mind a tiny country village containing
one large Catholic church and four
small Protestant churches—Baptist, Methodist,
Presbyterian, Episcopal. The Catholic church
holds services every Sunday, every holy day and
on many other occasions; these services are well
attended. Although the four Protestant
churches are very small they are not small
enough; some of them have long periods when
they are not opened at all, and the others are
never crowded.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that there should be many
sects and denominations among Protestants, for
the central principle of Protestantism is individual
judgment, which makes uniformity
neither possible nor desirable; and, indeed, in
large cities it is a good thing that we have so
many and such a variety of sectarian church
services.</p>

<p>For the variety is not in religious faith; they
are all following the same religion. The variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
is in the form of worship, what I call religious etiquette.</p>

<p>There are many people who on account of
their parentage and early associations love an
elaborate ritual, with the clergy in uniform, the
vested choir, etc. There are other persons,
equally devout, who are repelled by ritualism;
they like to see the minister in mufti and to have
a service as informal and simple as possible.
There are those who would be shocked by the
language used by certain soap-box exhorters,
but if they cannot endure these things they
might remember that God has to listen to them,
and take them as a compliment. Perhaps that
is what is meant by the Divine Patience. These
people feel religiously at home only in a dignified
and elaborate service. But there are others
who in a “high” church feel as if they were at an
opera; their senses may be touched, but their
hearts are cold. They are spectators, not worshippers.</p>

<p>How fortunate it is then that in every city of
reasonable size every Protestant has the power
of choice. If one church service or preacher
“gets on his nerves” he can go elsewhere, where
his precious nerves will be soothed rather than
ruffled, and he can worship God with an etiquette
to which he is accustomed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>When a young man and woman become engaged
to be married it is extremely probable that
during the courtship they will at one time or
another discuss religion; the girl will probably
ask the man for his views on the subject.</p>

<p>During the engagement of Robert Browning
and Elizabeth Barrett, when their communications
had to be mainly through the post office,
she wrote out her religious views, and he immediately
responded in an unequivocal manner.
Four years later he used these two letters as the
basis of his poem <cite>Christmas Eve</cite>. Elizabeth
pointed out the various characteristics of Christian
worship, from Roman Catholics to Unitarians,
saying that despite the irritating features in
many church services she could worship in any
of them, though she preferred those of the Dissenters.
She was one of those rare persons who
combine the most passionate convictions with
the largest tolerance. Too often religious convictions
produce bigoted narrow-mindedness;
too often tolerance is merely a complimentary
description of indifference.</p>

<p>There can be, then, genuine church unity
without uniformity, and I repeat that in large
cities this is well.</p>

<p>But there are, anyhow, two instances where
Protestant churches should combine and agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
on uniformity as well as on unity. These two
are foreign missions and small country towns.
The advantage of the former needs no argument;
among the many advantages of the latter
is one, often overlooked. The minister can
omit in his public preaching all nonessential
parts of his belief and confine his preaching sermons
to the very heart of the Gospel.</p>

<p>I have the best of reasons for knowing this
can be successfully accomplished, because in the
small corner of Michigan where I am now writing
we manage it every Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Huron City, on the nail of the “thumb” in
Michigan, was in 1865 a very much larger town
than it is today. In the old times of lumbering,
when the vast pine forests came down to the
shore of Lake Huron, this Huron City was a
scene of fierce and profitable activity. But
after the terrible forest fires of 1871 and 1881
the whole region passed from a timber to an
agricultural district, not without difficulty.
Gradually the people left and in most cases literally
took their houses with them. Today Huron
City has no post office, no railroad, no telegraph.
It is composed of a schoolhouse, a Methodist
church, a general store, a community house, two
or three farmers’ dwellings and our summer
home. I love it with all my heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>Every year the Methodist pastor, who has two
churches besides this one under his charge, yields
me the courtesy of his Huron City Methodist
pulpit for the summer, and here we have a service
every Sunday afternoon to which farmers
and “resorters” come from many miles around.</p>

<p>The point that I wish to emphasise is that in
all isolated communities like this it is not only
desirable but possible for members of widely different
churches and denominations to unite. In
order to find out how many religious sects were
represented in the audience we distributed cards
on which the members of the congregation were
asked to write their names, home town and
church. Here are the results on the last three
Sundays:</p>

<p>Adventists, 2; Baptists, 57; Roman Catholics,
42; Community churches, 11; Congregational,
39; Episcopalian, 83; Evangelical, 30; Jew, 6;

549; Moravian, 1; Presbyterian, 170; German
Reform, 13; Christian Scientist, 12; Swedenborgian,
2; Unitarian, 3; Universalist, 1; United
Brethren, 1; United Church of Canada, 4; members
of no church, 8.</p>

<span class="subhead">POLITICAL HISTORY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The majority of intelligent men and a considerable
number of intelligent women enjoy
reading authoritative and well-written books on
political history. I recommend to them the political
history of Great Britain and Ireland during
the last fifty years. I do not know of any
country or period—anyhow, since the French
Revolution in 1789—that affords so much interesting
material for serious consideration. And
this for two reasons.</p>

<p>First, I do not believe there has ever been a
country or an epoch when so many distinguished
men played so prominent parts in politics.</p>

<p>Second, I do not know of any time or place
where we have so much definite, precise and intimate
information supplied with so much detail
by the leading actors themselves.</p>

<p>Consider the following list of statesmen:
Gladstone, Disraeli, Bright, Parnell, Morley,
Bryce, Campbell-Bannerman, Chamberlain,
Balfour, Salisbury, Roseberry, Asquith, McCarthy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Healy, O’Connor, Lloyd George, Haldane,
Grey, Birrell, Baldwin, MacDonald,
Churchill.</p>

<p>Nearly all of these men had a first-class education,
were deeply read in the best literature,
and many of them were authorities in some field
of learning outside their profession as statesmen.
It is doubtful if any period of history can show a
group of politicians equal in intellectual culture
and in high character to these.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to obtain intimate knowledge of
the “inside politics” of the last fifty years, we
have Morley’s monumental life of Gladstone,
Morley’s own <cite>Recollections</cite> and <cite>Memorandum</cite>,
many Lives of Disraeli and Bright, T.&nbsp;P. O’Connor’s
<cite>Memoirs of an Old Parliamentarian</cite>, J.&nbsp;A.
Spender’s <cite>Life of Campbell-Bannerman</cite> and his
<cite>The Public Life</cite>, Asquith’s <cite>Memories and Reflections</cite>,
Churchill’s <cite>The World Crisis</cite>, Swift
MacNeill’s <cite>What I Have Seen and Heard</cite>, Haldane’s
<cite>Autobiography</cite>, Memoirs by Tim Healy,
Memoirs by Lord Grey, and many other works.</p>

<p>The history of Charles Stewart Parnell is one
of the most thrillingly dramatic and romantic
that can be found in either biography or legend.
His practical ability as a statesman is summed
up in a sentence in the <cite>Dictionary of National
Biography</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>“His influence on the course of English and
Irish history may be estimated by the fact that
when he entered public life home-rule for Ireland
was viewed by English politicians as a wild
impracticable dream, while within 11 years he
had induced a majority of one of the two great
English political parties to treat it as an urgent
necessity.”</p>

<p>Without meaning anything derogatory to his
character as a public man, the portraits of Parnell,
his attitude of command, and the methods
by which he controlled his party have always
brought to my mind the romantic pirate of melodrama.
His bearded impassive face, the greatest
“poker face” political history has ever known,
his quiet tones, his utterly mysterious personality,
his glacial manner, his iron resolution, his
rule of his party, every member of which had to
sign a pledge of absolute loyalty before he could
be elected to Parliament, his intolerance of any
partner in leadership, all combined to make him
a romantically grim figure, hated and dreaded by
his foes, dreaded and idolised by his followers.</p>

<p>They knew he alone could and would lead
them to victory; and then, when the ten years in
which he emerged from obscurity to dazzling
eminence were over, and victory was in his grasp,
he and his party went down to ruin through his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
infatuation for one woman, and in less than a
year he was in his grave.</p>

<p>For he was drunk with power as well as with
love; had he temporarily withdrawn from
leadership, his party would have gone on to triumph,
and within a very short period he would
undoubtedly have been called back to the throne.
But the absolute power he had enjoyed for years
made him insensible to the rules of the game of
life.</p>

<p>In September 1890, I saw Gladstone. He was
eighty years old, full of confidence and vitality,
for his partnership with Parnell, which had
lost the election in 1886, was now the means
of triumph, and it was a certainty that he would
soon be in a position to make the dream of Home
Rule a reality. But in November, in less than
two months, the divorce suit brought by Captain
O’Shea, in which Parnell was correspondent, and
the terrible scenes in December in Committee
Room No. 15 where Parnell tried in vain to
maintain his rule over his party, changed the
whole face of things.</p>

<p>After Gladstone brought in his Home Rule
Bill in 1886, politics became violent. The
Grand Old Man was hissed in London drawing-rooms.
I remember talking in 1880 with that
most extreme of Tories, Professor Mahaffy of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
the University of Dublin. I thought it strange
that differences in political opinion should ruin
personal friendship. “Why,” said Mahaffy excitedly,
“Gladstone and I have been intimate
friends for many years. If I met him on the
street now, I would cut him dead.”</p>

<p>Then I asked him about Parnell, and he said
contemptuously that Parnell’s relations with
women were scandalous. But I think he was
repeating the mere gossip of hatred; I do not
think he knew anything about Mrs. O’Shea, and
that he was as much surprised as anyone else
when the truth came out the very next year.</p>

<p>Parnell was a great man. As the years pass,
he will become more and more a legendary figure,
and there will probably be dozens of biographies
written about him. Already St. John Ervine, a
man of Belfast who used to hate Parnell, has
written a glowing, adulatory Life. I think we
probably come nearest to the real Parnell in
T.&nbsp;P. O’Connor’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>.</p>

<p>Those were the great days in Parliament.
Listen to “T.&nbsp;P.” on Gladstone.</p>

<p>“The most remarkable thing in the appearance
of Gladstone was his extraordinary eyes;
they were large, black, and flashing; sometimes
there came into them a look that was almost
wild.... The blackness and the brightness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
his eyes were brought into greater relief by the
almost deadly pallor of his complexion....
As he walked up the floor of the House he seemed
to be enveloped by a great solitude, so unmistakably
did he stand out from all the figures
around him.</p>

<p>I must add to this description of his extreme
physical gifts the wonderful quality of his voice.
It was a powerful voice, but sweet and melodious,
and it was managed as exquisitely and as
faithfully as the song of a great prima donna.
If the speech were ringing, it came to your ears
almost soft by that constant change of tone
which the voice displayed; it could whisper, it
could thunder.... I have seen many great
figures, but, with all respect to the greatest
among them, the House of Commons without
Gladstone seems to me as great a contrast as a
chamber illumined by a farthing dip when the
electric light has failed.”</p>

<p>What is the worst poem ever written by a man
of genius? It is certain that if an anthology
should be made of the most terrible verses of the
English bards the results would be both surprising
and appalling. I cannot at this moment
think of any worse pair of lines in English literature
than those offered in all seriousness by the
seventeenth-century poet, Richard Crashaw.
They occur in a poem containing many lovely
passages. In comparing the tearful eyes of
Mary Magdalene to many different things he
perpetrated a couplet more remarkable for ingenuity
than for beauty. Her eyes are</p>

<p>Alfred Tennyson, in his second volume of
poems, bearing the date 1833, included the following,
though it is only fair to say that he afterward
suppressed it. It aroused the mirth of the
critics and still is often resurrected as a specimen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
of what Tennyson could do when he was deserted
by both inspiration and taste.</p>

<p>Imagine the profanity and laughter this piffle
must have aroused among the book reviewers;
some of his severer critics called him “Miss Alfred,”
not knowing that he was a six-footer, with
a voice like a sea captain in a fog.</p>

<p>I have no mind to defend the poem. Apart
from the fact that the reading of it ought to teach
Americans the correct accent on the word “exquisite,”
it must be admitted that when Tennyson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
wrote this stuff he not only nodded but
snored.</p>

<p>But, although it is difficult for me to understand
how he could have written it, have read it
in proof and then published it, I perfectly understand
and sympathise with his enthusiasm for
the room.</p>

<p>It is often said that polygamous gentlemen
are—at any rate, for a considerable period—monogamous;
the Turk may have a long list of
wives, but he will cleave to one, either because
he wants to or because she compels him to.
Thus, even in a house that has a variety of sitting
rooms, or living rooms or whatever you
choose to call them, the family will use only one.
After the evening meal they will instinctively
move toward this one favourite room.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that even as dogs and cats
have their favourite corner or chair, or favourite
cushion of nightly repose, men and women have
favourite rooms. And if this is true of a family
in general, it is especially true of a man or a
woman whose professional occupation is writing;
and he becomes so attached to his room that
Tennyson’s sentiments, no matter how silly in
expression, accurately represent his emotion.</p>

<p>Twice a year, once in June and once in September,
circumstances force me to leave a room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
where I have for a long time spent the larger
part of my waking hours; I always feel the pain
of parting, look around the walls and at the desk
and wish the place an affectionate farewell, hoping
to see it again, either in the autumn or in the
next summer, as the case may be. I love that
room, as Tennyson loved his room. I love it not
because of the view from the windows, for a
working room should not have too good a view,
but for the visions that have there appeared to
the eyes of the mind. It is the place where I
have sat in thought, where such ideas as are possible
to my limited range have appeared to me
and where I have endeavoured to express them
in words.</p>

<p>And if I can have so strong a passion for a
room, with what tremendous intensity must an
inspired poet or novelist love the secluded chamber
where his imagination has found free play!</p>

<p>We know that Hawthorne, after his graduation
from college, spent twelve years in one room
in Salem. When he revisited that room as a
famous writer he looked at it with unspeakable
affection and declared that if ever he had a
biographer great mention must be made in his
memoir of this chamber, for here his mind and
character had been formed and here the immortal
children of his fancy had played around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
him. He was alone and not alone. As far as a
mortal man may understand the feelings of a
man of genius, I understand the emotion of
Hawthorne.</p>

<p>I think nearly every one, if he were able to
afford it, would like to have a room all his own.
I believe it to be an important factor in the development
of the average boy or girl if in the
family house each child could have one room
sacred to its own personality. When I was a
small boy, although I loved to be with family
and friends, I also loved to escape to my own
room and read and meditate in solitude.</p>

<p>The age of machinery is not so adverse to
spiritual development as the age of hotels and
apartment houses; there is no opportunity for
solitude, and a certain amount of solitude, serene
and secure from interruption, is almost essential
for the growth of the mind. A great many
girls and women could be saved from the curse
of “nerves” if there were a place somewhere in
the building where they could be for a time
alone. One of the worst evils of poverty is that
there is no solitude; eating, sleeping, living, all
without privacy.</p>

<p>When I was a graduate student in the university
I was fortunate enough to possess for one
year exactly the right kind of room. The young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
philosopher, George Santayana, came to see me
and exclaimed, “What a perfect room for a
scholar! The windows high up, as they should
be.” For if one is to have clear mental vision it
is not well that the room should have a view.</p>

<span class="subhead">TEA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Thank God,” said Sydney Smith, “thank
God for tea! What would the world do without
tea?—how did it exist? I am glad I was not
born before tea.” Well, I get along very well
without tea, though I rejoice to see that more
and more in “big business” houses in American
cities there is a fifteen-minute pause for afternoon
tea.</p>

<p>One of the chief differences between the life
of Englishmen and of Americans is tea. Millions
of Englishmen take tea three times a day.
Tea is brought to their bedside early in the morning,
and thirstily swallowed while in a horizontal
attitude. The first thing an Englishman thinks
of, if he wakes at dawn, is tea. When Arnold
Bennett was travelling in America he took a
limited train from New York to Chicago. Early
in the morning he rang for the porter and when
that individual appeared he commanded nonchalantly
a cup of tea. He might as well have
asked for a pot of hashish. The porter mechanically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
remarked that the “diner” would be put on
at such-and-such an hour. This unintelligible
contribution to the conversation was ignored by
the famous novelist, who repeated his demand
for tea. He was amazed to find there was no
tea. “And you call this a first-class train!”</p>

<p>Then at breakfast—a substantial meal in
British homes, though having somewhat the air
of a cafeteria—tea is drunk copiously. To the
average American tea for breakfast is flat and
unprofitable. We are accustomed to the most
inspiring beverage in the world, actual coffee.
The coffee in England is so detestable that when
an American tastes it for the first time he thinks
it is a mistake. And he is right. It is. Many
Americans give it up and reluctantly order tea.
In my judgment, for breakfast the worst coffee
is better than the best tea.</p>

<p>There are many Americans who have tea
served at luncheon. For some reason this seems
to the Englishman sacrilegious. The late Professor
Mahaffy, who is now (I suppose) drinking
nectar, was absolutely horrified to find that in
my house he was offered a cup of tea at lunch.
“Tea for lunch!” he screamed, and talked about
it for the rest of the meal.</p>

<p>I was invited by a charming American lady to
meet an English author at her house for luncheon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Tea was served and she said deprecatingly
to the British author, “I don’t suppose you have
tea at this time in England.” “Oh, yes,” said
he, “the servants often have it below stairs.”
To my delight, the hostess said, “Now, Mr. ——,
aren’t you really ashamed of offering me an insult
like that? Isn’t that remark of yours exactly
the kind of thing you are going to be
ashamed of when you think it over, all by yourself?”</p>

<p>At precisely 4:13 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> every day the average
Englishman has a thirst for the astringent taste
of tea. He does not care for hot water or hot
lemonade coloured with tea. He likes his tea so
strong that to me it has a hairy flavour. Many
years ago the famous Scot William Archer invited
me to his rooms in the Hotel Belmont,
New York, for afternoon tea at 4:15. He had
several cups and at five o’clock excused himself,
as he had to go out to an American home for tea.
I suggested that he had already had it. “Oh,
that makes no difference.”</p>

<p>There are several good reasons (besides bad
coffee) for tea in England. Breakfast is often at
nine (the middle of the morning to me), so that
early tea is desirable. Dinner is often at eight-thirty,
so that afternoon tea is by no means superfluous.
Furthermore, of the three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
and sixty-five days of the year in England, very,
very few are warm; and afternoon tea is not
only cheerful and sociable but in most British
interiors really necessary to start the blood circulating.</p>

<p>There are few more agreeable moments in life
than tea in an English country house in winter.
It is dark at four o’clock. The family and guests
come in from the cold air. The curtains are
drawn, the open wood fire is blazing, the people
sit down around the table and with a delightful
meal—for the most attractive food in England
is served at afternoon tea—drink of the cheering
beverage.</p>

<p>William Cowper, in the eighteenth century,
gave an excellent description:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now stir the fire and close the shutters fast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Throws up a steamy column, and the cups</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That cheer but not inebriate wait on each,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So let us welcome peaceful evening in.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not long before this poem was written the
traveller Jonas Hanway had the bad luck to publish
an essay on tea, “considered as pernicious to
health, obstructing industry, and impoverishing
the nation,” which naturally drew the artillery
fire of the great Dr. Johnson. Sir John Hawkins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
in his life of Johnson, comments on this
controversy. He says: “That it is pernicious to
health is disputed by physicians”—where have I
heard something like that recently? But
Hawkins continues: “Bishop Burnet, for many
years, drank sixteen large cups of it every morning,
and never complained that it did him the
least injury.”</p>

<p>As for Johnson, “he was a lover of tea to an
excess hardly credible; whenever it appeared,
he was almost raving, and by his impatience to
be served, his incessant calls for those ingredients
which make that liquor palatable, and the
haste with which he swallowed it down, he seldom
failed to make that a fatigue to every one
else, which was intended as a general refreshment.”</p>

<p>In nearly every English novel I find the expression,
“I am dying for my tea!” On a voyage
to Alaska, where tea was served on deck
every afternoon, at precisely the same moment
an elderly British lady appeared from below with
precisely the same exclamation: “Oh, is there
tea going?” And on her face was a holy look.</p>

<p>Alfred Noyes told me that during the war,
when he was writing up important incidents for
the benefit of the public, he was assigned to interview
the sailors immediately after the tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
naval battle of Jutland. He found a
bluejacket who had been sent aloft and kept
there during the fearful engagement, when shells
weighing half a ton came hurtling through the
air and when ships blew up around him. Thinking
he would get a marvellous “story” out of this
sailor, Mr. Noyes asked him to describe his sensations
during those frightful hours. All the
man said was, “Well, of course, I had to miss my
tea!”</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WEATHER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Nearly all the great poetry of the world, ancient
and modern, has been written in Europe.
This fact should never be forgotten in reading
literature that alludes to the weather. The reason
every one talks about the weather is not that
the average person has nothing else to say; it is
that the weather is usually the most interesting
topic available. It is the first thing we think of
in the hour of waking; it affects our plans, projects
and temperament.</p>

<p>When I was a little boy at school there was a
song sung in unison called “Hail, Autumn, Jovial
Fellow!” It seemed to me to express correctly
the true character of autumn. It was not until
I had reached maturity in years that I discovered
that the song, as judged by the world’s most
famous writers, was a misfit. Instead of autumn’s
being jovial, it was dull, damp, dark, depressing.
To be sure, I never really felt that
way about it; the evidence of my eyes was in
favour of the school song, but, as the great poets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
had given autumn a bad reputation, I supposed
in some way she must have earned it.</p>

<p>Still later I learned that Goethe was right
when he said that in order to understand a poet
you must personally visit the country where he
wrote. Literary geography is seldom taught or
seriously considered, but it is impossible to read
famous authors intelligently without knowing
their climatic and geographical environment.
So keenly did I come to feel about this that I
finally prepared a cardboard map of England,
marking only the literary places, and I required
my students to become familiar with it. One of
them subsequently wrote me a magnificent testimonial,
which I have often considered printing
on the margin of the map.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Mr. Phelps—I have been bicycling all over
England this summer, and have found your Literary
Map immensely useful. I have carried it inside my
shirt, and I think on several occasions it has saved
me from an attack of pneumonia.</p>
</div>

<p>There are millions of boys and girls studying
Shakespeare in South Africa, Australia and New
Zealand; the poet’s frequent allusions to the
climate and the weather must seem strange.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That you have such a February face.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>February “down under” is midsummer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Southern latitudes give the lie to Shakespeare’s
metaphors.</p>

<p>The reason autumn has so bad a name in the
world’s poetry and prose is that autumn in
Northern Europe is a miserable season. In London,
Paris, Berlin, November (and often October)
is one of the worst times of the year. A
chronically overcast sky, a continual drizzle, a
damp chill even on mistily rainless days, combine
to produce gloom. The first autumn and
winter I spent in Paris revised my notions of
those two seasons. As an American, I had
thought of the difference between summer and
winter as a difference only in temperature; I
reasonably expected as much sunshine in autumn
and winter as in summer. A typical January
day in New York is cold and cloudless.</p>

<p>Well, in Paris the sun disappeared for weeks
at a time, and on the rare occasions when it
shone people ran out in the street to look at it.
One of the worst jokes in the world is the expression,
“sunny France.” The French themselves
know better. François Coppée wrote of
the “rare smiles” of the Norman climate, and
Anatole France, describing a pretty girl, wrote
“Her eyes were grey; the grey of the Paris sky.”</p>

<p>For the same reason “Italian skies” have been
overpraised, because their eulogists are English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
or French or German. The Italian sky is usually
so much better than the sky of more northerly
European localities that it seems good by
contrast. Now, as a matter of fact the winter
sky over Bridgeport, Conn., is superior in brightness
and blueness to the sky over Florence or
Venice.</p>

<p>November, one of the best months of the year
in America, is dreaded by all who live in France,
England or Germany. Walking in New Haven
one brilliant (and quite typical) day in mid-November,
exhibiting the university and city
to a visiting French professor, I enquired, “What
do you think of our November climate?” He
replied, “It is crazy.”</p>

<p>A strange thing is that Bryant, born in the
glorious Berkshires of western Massachusetts,
where autumn, instead of being pale and wet as
the European poets have described it, is brilliant
and inspiring, all blue and gold, did not use his
eyes; he followed the English poetical tradition.</p>

<p>One difference between the temperament of
the typical Englishman and the typical American
is caused largely by the climate, and foreigners
in writing books about us should not
forget the fact. If nearly every morning the
sky were overcast and the air filled with drizzle,
we might not be quite so enthusiastic.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the early spring in England
and France is more inspiring than ours, perhaps
by reason of the darkness of winter. It comes
much earlier. Alfred Housman says:</p>

<span class="subhead">WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>War is a sentimental affair; that is why it is so
difficult to abolish. War is opposed to the dictates
of common sense, prudence, rationality,
and wisdom. But the sentiments of man and
the passions of man are deeper, more elemental,
and more primitive than his intelligence, knowledge,
and reasoning powers. For intelligence
and morality belong to man alone; his instincts
he shares with the entire animal creation.</p>

<p>My own plan for getting rid of war would not
win a peace prize, because it would never be
adopted. But I believe it strikes at the root of
war—sentiment. My plan would be to spoil the
good looks of the officers and also take away all
their drums, fifes, and brass bands. The uniforms
are altogether too handsome, too attractive,
too becoming.</p>

<p>It is a familiar saying that every woman is in
love with a uniform; to which I would add that
every man is also. The naval officers look magnificent
in their bright blue frock coats, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
yellow buttons, and their shining epaulets.
These gorgeous hawks of war are decorated by
the government as lavishly as Nature, the greatest
of all tailors, fits out her birds of prey. A
naval officer excels in brilliance the appearance
of a civilian, even as the gay feathers of a sparrowhawk
excel those of a sparrow.</p>

<p>Furthermore, every military and naval officer
has a capable man to look after his wardrobe.
Not only are his various uniforms beautiful in
design and ornamentation, they are without spot
or blemish. His trousers are mathematically
creased, his coat unwrinkled, his linen like virgin
snow. My suggestion is, that if you really want
to get rid of war, the first thing to do is to compel
all professional warriors to wear ill-fitting hand-me-downs,
shabby and unpressed, and without
gold trimmings. The glamour and the glory
would vanish with the gold.</p>

<p>Then I would abolish the dance of death. Instead
of having perfect drill, hundreds of men
deploying with exactitude, I would make them
look like Coxey’s Army, every man for himself,
and the devil take the hindmost.</p>

<p>But above all, I would silence the drum and
fife, and the big brass band. Although I myself
hate war, and should like to see it abolished,
whenever I hear the thrilling roll of the drums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
and the shrill scream of the fifes, followed by the
sight and sound of marching men, their bayonets
gleaming in the sunshine, I want to cry. A
lump comes up in my throat and I am ready to
fight anybody or anything. If you really want
to get rid of war, you must not surround it with
pomp and majesty, you must not give it such a
chance at our hearts.</p>

<p>Although wars are never started by warriors,
but only by politicians and tradesmen, for the
very last place where a foreign war could begin
would be at Annapolis or West Point; still, there
is no doubt that high officers have a ripping time
during a great war, and that the surviving soldiers
love to talk about it (among themselves) at
their regular reunions in later years. Shakespeare,
himself no soldier, understood perfectly
how the professional feels. This is the
farewell he put in the mouth of Othello:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell the tranquil mind: farewell content!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The royal banner, and all quality,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even so: Othello was a sentimentalist. He
had more passion than brains. That is why
Iago and not Desdemona made him jealous;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
that is why, with the loss of war and women, he
lost everything. He was without any intellectual
resources.</p>

<p>The leaders of thought and the leaders of
morals have usually been against war. Although
the historical books of the Old Testament
and the emotional Psalms celebrated the
glory of war, the contemporary sober-minded
prophets were against it. They prophesied the
coming of universal peace, when the money
spent on armaments would be devoted to agriculture
and to education. The appearance of
Jesus was the signal for peace on earth and good
will to men.</p>

<p>Jonathan Swift, more than two hundred years
ago, said that men were less intelligent than
beasts. A single wild beast would fight for his
food or his mate; but you could never, said Swift,
induce a lot of wild beasts to line up in dress
parade, and then fight another set of wild beasts,
whom they did not know.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin, the wisest of Americans,
immediately after the Revolutionary War,
which he had helped to win, said there had never
been a good war or a bad peace.</p>

<p>But although the wisdom and morality of
mankind have been against war, war goes on;
the moment it breaks out in any country, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
the forces of sentimentalism are employed to
glorify, yes, even to sanctify its course. The
first great casualty is Reason.</p>

<p>What shall we say of a scholar like the late
Sir Walter Raleigh, Professor of English Literature
at Oxford? He continually ridiculed religion
for its sentimentality; but the moment
the great war broke out, no school-girl was more
sentimental than he.</p>

<p>Thus the hope for peace lies not in the poets,
the literary men, the preachers and the philanthropists;
the hope lies in hardheaded Scotsmen
like Ramsay MacDonald, whose idealism is
built on a foundation of shrewd sense.</p>

<span class="subhead">MAN AND BOY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>F.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A., in his excellent Conning Tower in the
<cite>New York World</cite> for the Ides of March, pays a
fine tribute to E.&nbsp;W. Howe and his paragraphs
long ago in the Atchison <cite>Globe</cite>. He says:
“There were two paragraphs that appeared just
about the time we began reading the <cite>Globe</cite>,
which we are willing to bet were written by Ed
himself. He was less oracular in those days.
They were something like the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘We have been editing a newspaper for twenty-five
years, and have learned that the only thing a newspaper
can safely attack is the man-eating shark.</p>

<p>‘A boy thinks, “What a fine time a man has!” And
a man thinks, “What a fine time a boy has!” And
what a rotten time they both have!’”</p>
</div>

<p>There is a strange reluctance on the part of
most people to admit that they enjoy life. Having
the honour of a personal acquaintance with
both F.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A. and Ed Howe, it is my belief they
both had a happy childhood and that they are
now having a good time in this strangest of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
possible worlds. No one can judge another’s
inner state of mind, but as these distinguished
humorists are men of unusually high intelligence
I think they find life immensely interesting;
and to be constantly interested is to be happy.</p>

<p>I remember a magnificent reply made by F.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A.
to a remark of that hirsute Englishman,
D.&nbsp;H. Lawrence; the latter, commenting in that
tactless fashion so characteristic of foreign
visitors to these shores, said, “It must be terrible
to be funny every day.” “No,” said F.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A.,
“not so terrible as never to be funny at all.”</p>

<p>I spent an agreeable afternoon in Florida
talking with Ed Howe, or rather in hearing him
talk. He told a succession of anecdotes and
stories, and it was clear that he not only enjoyed
telling them, which he did with consummate art,
but that he enjoyed having them in his mind.</p>

<p>Why is it so many people are afraid to admit
they are happy? I have a large and intimate
acquaintance with farmers; many of them are
splendid men. But how cautious they are in
their replies to casual questions! If everything
is going as well as could possibly be expected and
you ask them how they are, they say, “Can’t
complain.”</p>

<p>If a man says, “I have had and am having a
happy life,” he is regarded by many as being a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
shallow and superficial thinker; but if he says,
“My most earnest wish is that I had never been
born,” many believe that he has a profound
mind.</p>

<p>With regard to the saying quoted from the
Atchison <cite>Globe</cite> that a boy thinks a man has a
fine time and a man thinks a boy has a fine time
and in reality both have a rotten time—well, the
statement, whoever said it, is shallow and untrue.
When I was a boy I had lots of fun, and
I deeply pitied old men of thirty-two because I
supposed they had no fun at all. Then, when I
became a man, I realised how enormously richer
in happiness is manhood than boyhood.</p>

<p>The average American boy has a pretty good
time. What fun, on emerging from school on
Friday afternoon, to know that tomorrow is Saturday!
What fun to play games, to go on exploring
adventures in neighbouring woods, to
have picnics and jollifications, to live a life of
active uselessness! The mere physical health
of boyhood makes one feel like a young dog released
from a chain. “Mere living” is good.</p>

<p>I remember seeing a picture of an old man
addressing a small boy. “How old are you?”
“Well, if you go by what Mama says, I’m five.
But if you go by the fun I’ve had, I’m most a
hundred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>Joseph Conrad, who was a grave and serious
man, said he was neither an optimist nor a pessimist.
He did not think life was perfect, but
pessimism, he said, was intellectual arrogance.
He made the point that no matter what was one’s
religion or philosophy, this at all events is a
spectacular universe.</p>

<p>To deny life, to show no appreciation of it,
seems to me both ungrateful and stupid. If you
showed a man the Himalaya Mountains, the
ocean in a storm, sunrise in the desert, the Court
of Honour in 1893, the Cathedral of Chartres,
and he looked at them all with a lack-lustre eye,
we should think him stupid. Well, the universe
itself is tremendously spectacular, and the best
shows in it are free. To go through life in rebellion,
disgust or even in petulance, is the sign,
not of a great, but of a dull mind.</p>

<p>How ridiculous it is for a boy to wish he were
a man and how much more ridiculous for a man
to wish he were a boy! It is as silly as crying
for the moon. Instead of always longing for
something beyond our reach, why not simply
make the best of what we have? This would be
a platitude if it were not that so very few people
follow it.</p>

<p>There is certainly enough sorrow in the world,
but I sometimes think we should enjoy life more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
if we had more of the divine gift of appreciation,
if we were not so unappreciative. When Addison
thanked God for the various pleasures of life,
he thanked Him most of all for a cheerful heart.</p>

<p>More than two hundred years ago he wrote in
the <cite>Spectator</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ten thousand thousand precious gifts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My daily thanks employ;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor is the least a cheerful heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That tastes these gifts with joy.</div>
  </div>

<span class="subhead">AMBITION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>What do we really mean when we say of a
man, “He is too good for this world?” Do we
mean exactly that, do we mean he is so far
loftier in character than the average person that
he seems almost out of place in a world like this?
Don’t we rather mean that he lacks human sympathy
and understanding, and therefore can be
of no real use to anybody?</p>

<p>If you remember the character of Hilda in
Hawthorne’s novel, <cite>The Marble Faun</cite>, you may
remember that she used to be held up as an ideal
of the religious life. “Her soul was like a star
and dwelt apart.” But from the selfish sanctity
of its seclusion, no real good resulted; no
one was aided or cheered in the struggle of life.
No one could confide in her, for she could not
even confide in herself. Her nature may have
had the purity of an angel, but it lacked the
purity of a noble woman. She was no help to
sinners; she was their despair. Her purity was
like that of one who hesitates to rescue a drowning
man, for fear of soiling his clothes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>Hilda gave up the world and worldly pleasure;
easily enough, for she abhorred it, and felt ill at
ease in society. But though she gave up many
things precious to the average person, she had
no conception of the meaning of the word <em>self</em>-denial.</p>

<p>For the true sacrifice, if one wishes to be of
real use in this world, consists not in the giving
of things, but in giving oneself. If a man’s life
consists not in the abundance of things which
he possesses, so the sacrificial life consists not
in the number of luxuries one surrenders, but in
the devotion of oneself, in the denial of the will.
There is a certain kind of purity which is fundamentally
selfish.</p>

<p>This manner of asceticism is not particularly
common nowadays, and we need not fear that it
will be too generally practiced. I am calling
attention to it in order to show that selfishness
may take on the mask of purity or of respectability,
a selfishness that springs from pure
moral motives and a longing for the elevation of
character.</p>

<p>But there is another type of respectable selfishness
that is far more common, possibly more
common in America than in any other country.
It is not usually recognised as selfishness, but regarded
as one of the greatest—perhaps the greatest—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the virtues. It is seen chiefly among
earnest and ambitious young men, who assume
that life is not a holiday, but a serious affair,
a struggle, a strictly competitive race, where if
you stop a moment, even for reflexion, you are
left behind.</p>

<p>We are bound to respect these men. They
have at all events found out half the secret of
life. They have set before themselves some
goal, in politics, in business, in literature, and
they are determined to reach it. They are
equally determined to gain the prize by no dishonourable
means. Their minds are full of the
lessons learned from their predecessors, men
who by the sacrifice of temporary pleasures, by
the refusal to indulge in recreation or relaxation,
have surpassed their competitors and reached
the top.</p>

<p>We are constantly told that it is only by intense
concentration, by terrific efforts day and
night, and by keeping the end constantly in view
that one can attain success. Surely these young
men are to be admired, surely they are models,
examples worthy of emulation?</p>

<p>Well, they are better than criminals, they are
better than parasites, they are better than
drones. But their driving motive is selfishness.
Tennyson wrote <cite>The Palace of Art</cite>, Browning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
wrote <cite>Paracelsus</cite>, because each of these poets
knew that his individual danger was not what is
usually known as “temptation.” They knew
that they would never go to hell by the crowded
highway of dissipation, for they were above the
mere call of the blood. Their danger lay in a
high and noble ambition, which has wrecked
many first-rate minds.</p>

<p>Modern life tends to encourage this respectable
selfishness. The central law of the so-called
science of Economics is selfishness. A
whole science is built on one foundation—that
every man in the world will get all he can for
himself. The subject is naturally studied not
from an ethical, but from a scientific standpoint.
Life is a race.</p>

<p>Now I believe that Efficiency—mere practical
success in the world—is as false an ideal as asceticism.
If the morality of withdrawal is not
good enough, neither is the morality of success.
Those deserve the highest admiration and the
most profound respect who have actually aided
their human brethren, who have left the world
better than they found it.</p>

<p>This is by no means a hopeless ideal of character.
It is not necessary to crush a tyrant or
to organise a revolution or to reconstruct society
or to be a professional reformer. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
plenty of professional reformers who have tremendous
enthusiasm for humanity and who
have never helped an individual. Those who
by unselfish lives and consideration for others
elevate the tone of the community in which
they live and who by their presence make others
happier, these are the salt of the earth. Their
daily existence is more eloquent than a sermon.</p>

<p>American young men and women in our High
Schools and universities are not often face to
face with the mystery of life. They have no
conception of the amount of suffering in the
world. Their own lives are comparatively free
from it, in many cases free even from anxiety.
These boys and girls are for the most part sensible,
alert, quick-witted, and practical; what I
should like to see would be a change in their
ideals from mere Success to something nobler.
I should like to see them devoting their intelligence
and energy to the alleviation of suffering
and to the elevation of human thought and life.</p>

<p>If one still believes that the highest happiness
and satisfaction come from the attainment of
any selfish ambition, no matter how worthy in
itself, it is well to remember the significance of
the fact that Goethe, acknowledged to be one of
the wisest of men, made Faust happy only when
he was unselfishly interested in the welfare of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
others; and to remember that Benjamin Franklin,
perhaps the shrewdest of all shrewd Americans,
found the greatest pleasure of his long life
in two things—public service and individual
acts of kindness.</p>

<span class="subhead">BIRDS AND STATESMEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When, in the Spring of 1910, Theodore Roosevelt
was on his way to England from his African
explorations, he wrote a strange letter to the
British Foreign Office in London. I call it a
strange letter, because it is the kind of epistle
one would not expect to be sent by an ex-executive
of one country to the Foreign Office of another.
He wrote that during his stay in England
he would like to make an excursion into the
woods, hear the English songbirds and learn
their names; in order that he might do this satisfactorily
and intelligently, would the Foreign
Office please select some naturalist who knew
the note of every bird in England and request
him to accompany Mr. Roosevelt on this expedition?</p>

<p>Well, the head of the British Foreign Office
was Sir Edward Grey and he himself knew the
note of every singing bird in England—a remarkable
accomplishment for one of the busiest
statesmen in the world. He therefore appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
himself as bird-guide for the ex-President of the
United States.</p>

<p>The two distinguished men stood on a railway
platform one day in May and were surrounded
by reporters, who supposed that a new world-problem
of the first magnitude was on the carpet.
But the two men told the reporters that they
were going away into the country for two days,
did not wish to be disturbed, and asked the
journalists to leave them alone. Accordingly,
it was generally believed that Roosevelt and
Grey were absorbed in the discussion of international
affairs, and as the great war broke out a
few years later, some went so far as to believe
then that it had its origin in this sinister interview.</p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, the two men did not
mention either war or politics; they went a-walking
in the New Forest and every time they
heard the voice of a bird, Grey told Roosevelt
the singer’s name. They both agreed (and so
do I) that the English blackbird is the best
soloist in Great Britain.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that the four most famous
birds in English literature are none of them
native in America. The Big Four are the Nightingale,
the Skylark, the Blackbird and the
Cuckoo. From Chaucer to Kipling the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
poets have chanted the praise of the Nightingale.
And of all the verses in his honour, it is
perhaps the tribute by Keats that is most worthy
of the theme.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thou was not born for death, immortal Bird!</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No hungry generations tread thee down;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The voice I hear this passing night was heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">In ancient days by emperor and clown:</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We never had nightingales in the United
States until Edward W. Bok imported them into
his Bird Paradise in Florida. Previous attempts
to bring them over had failed; the birds
invariably died. Some investigators declared
that this tragedy was owing to the change of
diet; but of course the real reason for their death
was American poetry. After the nightingales
had listened for centuries to Chaucer, Shakespeare,
Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, etc., the
change to the level of American verse was too
much for them, and they died of shock.</p>

<p>The English skylark leaves the grass and soars
aloft, singing his heart out, so that after he has
disappeared in the sky, we hear his voice coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
down out of the blue, like a revelation. One of
the poets calls it a “sightless song.”</p>

<p>Shakespeare sends the skylark to the gate of
heaven.</p>

<p>And Shelley’s poem on the skylark expresses
the ethereal nature of the soaring voice of this
bird:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Higher still and higher</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From the earth thou springest,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">The blue deep thou wingest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And singing still dost soar, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Soaring ever singest.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>American blackbirds do not sing well; the so-called
crow-blackbird, so common in flocks in
autumn, makes a noise like tonsillitis, or as if he
had a boy’s voice in process of changing, or as if
he were a hinge that needed oiling. Our redwing
blackbird, with his scarlet epaulets, has a
good-natured and perky wheeze, which can
hardly be called singing. But the English and
Continental blackbird pours out of his throat
the most heavenly melody. One Winter day in
Munich, in the midst of a snowstorm, I saw a
blackbird perched on a tree directly in front of
the University building. He was “hove to,”
that is, he had his beak turned directly into the
wind, and as the snowflakes beat against his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
little face, he sent straight into the gale the
loveliest music. Tennyson has observed how
the voice of the blackbird loses its beauty in the
hot Summer days.</p>

<p>The nearest we Americans can get to the English
cuckoo is the abominable cuckoo clock.
The voice of the English cuckoo sounds exactly
like the clock, only of course you can’t train him
to strike right. In addition to his regular accomplishment,
he is a ventriloquist and can
throw his voice a tremendous distance. One
day, crossing a field in Sussex, I heard the loud
double note of the cuckoo, apparently directly
behind me. He was in reality a furlong away.</p>

<span class="subhead">RUSSIA BEFORE THE REVOLUTION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The best way to invade Russia is by sea; and I
advise those who plan to visit the Soviet Republic
to go via Stockholm. Copenhagen, Christiania,
Stockholm are three interesting cities and
should be seen in that order. Stockholm, the
“Venice of the North,” is one of the most beautiful,
most picturesque, and most attractive places
in the world.</p>

<p>It is surprising that the short sea voyage from
Stockholm to Saint Petersburg (now Leningrad)
is not better known; it is enchantingly beautiful.
We left Stockholm at six o’clock in the evening
of a fine September day, and as our tiny
steamer drew away, the sunset light over the
fair city hung a new picture on the walls of my
mind. It took some five hours to reach the
Baltic, five hours of constantly changing scenery,
one view melting into another like a succession
of dissolving panoramas. Hundreds of
miniature islands dotted with châteaux and
country houses; winking lighthouse towers;
“the grey sea and the long black land.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>An impossible half-moon lent the last touch
of glory to the scene. We stood on the top deck
and beheld the spacious firmament on high,
thick inlaid with patines of bright gold; while
the long level light of the crazy moon fell across
the darkening water and the myriad islands.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night we crossed the Baltic,
and in the whitening dawn entered the gulf
of Finland. The air was nipping and eager, but
the sun rose in a cloudless sky. All day long the
steamer nosed her way through the blue sea,
twisting and turning among the countless points
of the earth’s surface that were just able to keep
their heads above water. A few of these were
covered with green grass, and supported white
farm buildings where laughing children accompanied
by dignified dogs ran out to see our
transit; but for the most part these elevations
were bald, with a tall lighthouse as sole decoration.</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon we reached Helsingfors
(still my farthest north) and stepped ashore
to spend six hours in seeing the town, the boat
not proceeding toward Russia until late in the
night. The clouded sky was low and harsh the
next morning, and the sea was surly. Toward
noon it cleared, and early in the afternoon we
saw the gilded domes and spires of Holy Russia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
After a long delay with passports, we drove
across one of the bridges over the Neva to our
hotel at a corner of the Nevski Prospekt. Although
it was only September, the temperature
was under fifty, and seemed colder.</p>

<p>I had a severe cold, which had its origin in a
chill I had caught in rashly touching a piece of
toast that a waiter brought me in a London
hotel. But I was right in style. Accustomed
as I was to see on the streets of any American
city the healthy, cheerful, well-clad and well-shod
men and women, I was appalled by the
faces and the clothes of the Russians. What
they look like today I know not, but a more unhappy
looking crowd than I saw every day on
the streets of Russian cities I have never seen
outside of pictures of Hell. Many of the people
had their ears and mouths bandaged and on their
feet were (if they could afford it) enormous
knee-boots. All seemed to be suffering from the
foot and mouth disease.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget the boots and overcoats
and uniforms on the Nevski Prospekt. The
question of leg-clothes would have interested
the author of <cite>Sartor Resartus</cite>. In Edinburgh
all the men and some of the women wore
knickers, with stockings that seemed an inch
thick. Compared with Europeans, Americans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
are tropically clad. In order to avoid the glare
of publicity, I bought in Scotland a homespun
golf suit.</p>

<p>I tried these abbreviated trousers just once on
the Nevski Prospekt. Everybody stopped to
stare. Had I worn a flowing purple robe, I
should not have attracted such attention. Military
officers gazed at me in cold amazement, as
though I had leprosy; while the more naïve
passers made audible comment, which fortunately
I could not translate. Then I tried the
experiment of conventional clothing, but wore
low shoes. Everyone gazed at my feet, some in
wonder, some in admiration, some in terror. I
felt as I did many years ago when I wore a
striped cap in Brussels. A stranger looked at
me earnestly and then said in an almost reverent
tone, and he said it three times: <i lang="fr">Nom de Dieu!</i></p>

<p>In America our citizens show much the same
interest in strange clothing. Professor E.&nbsp;B.
Wilson, a distinguished mathematician, bought
a suit of clothes in Paris. He wore it only once
in America. A citizen gazed at him steadfastly,
and said “J——!”</p>

<p>The faces of the common people in Russian
cities were sad to behold, whether one saw them
on the street or in church. Not only was there
no hilarity, such as one sees everywhere in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
American towns; those faces indicated a total
lack of illuminating intelligence. They were
blank, dull, apathetic, helpless. Gorki said that
the people in Russia had so little to look forward
to that they were glad when their own houses
burned down, as it made a break in the dull
routine of life.</p>

<p>One afternoon I walked the entire length of
the Nevski Prospekt, no mean achievement in a
heavy overcoat. I began at the banks of the
restless, blustering Neva, passed the extraordinary
statue of Peter the Great, came through the
garden by the statue of Gogol, and with the thin
gold spire of the Admiralty at my back, entered
the long avenue.</p>

<p>I followed the immense extension of the
Nevski, clear to the cemetery, and stood reverently
before the tomb of Dostoevski. Here in
January, 1881, the body of the great novelist
was laid in the grave, in the presence of forty
thousand mourners.</p>

<p>In a corner of the enclosure I found the tomb
of the composer Chaikovski; I gazed on the last
resting-place of Glinka, father of Russian music.
On account of the marshy soil, the graves are
built above instead of below the surface of the
ground, exactly as they are in New Orleans. It
is in reality a city of the dead, the only place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
where a Russian finds peace. I passed out on
the other side of the cemetery, walked through
the grounds of the convent, and found myself
abruptly clear from the city, on the edge of a
vast plain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_119">XXII<br>

<span class="subhead">THE DEVIL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is rather a pity that the Devil has vanished
with Santa Claus and other delectable myths;
the universe is more theatrical with a “personal
devil” roaming at large, seeking whom he may
devour. In the book of Job the Devil played
the part of the return of the native, coming
along in the best society in the cosmos to appear
before the Presence. And when he was asked
where he came from, he replied in a devilishly
debonair manner, “From going to and fro in the
earth, and from walking up and down in it.”</p>

<p>There are so many things in this world that
seem to be the Devil’s handiwork, and there are
so many people who look like the devil, that it
seems as if he could not be extinct. His chief
service to the universal scene was to keep virtue
from becoming monotonous; to warn even saints
that they must mind their step; to prove that
eternal vigilance is the price of safety. The
Enemy of Mankind never took a holiday.
Homer might nod, but not he. In fact, on human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
holidays he was, if possible, unusually efficient.
The idleness of man was the opportunity
of Satan.</p>

<p>The principle of evil is so active, so tireless, so
penetrating that the simplest way to account for
it is to suppose that men and things receive constantly
the personal attention of the Devil.
Weeds, and not vegetables, grow naturally; illness,
not health, is contagious; children and
day-labourers are not instinctively industrious;
champagne tastes better than cocoa.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle Ages, although every
one believed steadfastly in the reality of the
Devil and that he was the most unscrupulous
of all foes, there was a certain friendliness with
him, born, I suppose, of daily intimacy. It was
like the way in which hostile sentries will hobnob
with one another, swap tobacco, etc., in the
less tense moments of war. The Devil was always
just around the corner and would be glad
of an invitation to drop in.</p>

<p>Thus in the mediæval mystery plays, the forerunners
of our modern theatres, the Devil was
always the Clown. He supplied “comic relief”
and was usually the most popular personage in
the performance. He appeared in the conventional
makeup, a horrible mask, horns, cloven
hoofs and prehensile tail, with smoke issuing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
from mouth, ears and posterior. He did all
kinds of acrobatic feats, and his appearance was
greeted with shouts of joy. In front of that
part of the stage representing Hellmouth he
was sometimes accompanied with “damned
souls,” persons wearing black tights with yellow
stripes. On an examination at Yale I set the
question, “Describe the costume of the characters
in the mystery plays.” One of the students
wrote: “The damned souls wore Princeton
colours.”</p>

<p>The modern circus clown comes straight from
the Devil. When you see him stumble and fall
all over himself, whirl his cap aloft and catch it
on his head, distract the attention of the spectators
away from the gymnasts to his own antics,
he is doing exactly what his ancestor the
Devil did in the mediæval plays.</p>

<p>It is at first thought singular that those audiences,
who believed implicitly in a literal hell of
burning flame, should have taken the Devil as
the chief comic character. I suppose the only
way to account for this is to remember how essential
a feature of romantic art is the element
of the grotesque, which is a mingling of horror
and humour, like our modern spook plays. If
you pretend that you are a hobgoblin and chase
a child, the child will flee in real terror, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
moment you stop, the child will say, “Do that
again.”</p>

<p>There are many legends of compacts with the
Devil, where some individual has sold his soul
to gain the whole world. The most famous of
these stories is, of course, <cite>Faust</cite>, but there are
innumerable others. Here is a story I read in an
American magazine some fifty years ago.</p>

<p>A man, threatened with financial ruin, was
sitting in his library when the maid brought in
a visiting card and announced that a gentleman
would like to be admitted. On the card was
engraved</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">
Mr. Apollo Lyon.
</p>

<p>As the man looked at it his eyes blurred, the two
words ran together, so they seemed to form the
one word</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">
Apollyon.
</p>

<p>The gentleman was shown in; he was exquisitely
dressed and was evidently a suave man
of the world. He proposed that the one receiving
him should have prosperity and happiness
for twenty years. Then Mr. Lyon would call
again and be asked three questions. If he failed
to answer any of the three the man should keep
his wealth and prosperity. If all three were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
correctly answered the man must accompany
Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p>The terms were accepted; all went well for
twenty years. At the appointed time appeared
Mr. Lyon, who had not aged in the least; he was
the same smiling, polished gentleman. He was
asked a question that had floored all the theologians.
Mr. Lyon answered it without hesitation.
The second question had stumped all
the philosophers, but it had no difficulties for
Mr. Lyon.</p>

<p>Then there was a pause, and the sweat stood
out on the questioner’s face. At that moment
his wife came in from shopping. She was rosy
and cheerful. After being introduced to Mr.
Lyon she noticed her husband was nervous. He
denied this, but said that he and Mr. Lyon were
playing a little game of three questions and he
did not want to lose. She asked permission to
put the third question and in desperation her
husband consented. She held out her new hat
and asked: “Mr. Lyon, which is the front end
of this hat?” Mr. Lyon turned it around and
around, and then with a strange exclamation
went straight through the ceiling, leaving behind
him a strong smell of sulphur.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FORSYTE SAGA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is impossible to say what books of our time
will be read at the close of this century; it is
probable that many of the poems and tales of
Kipling, the lyrics of Housman, dramatic narratives
by Masefield, some plays by Shaw and
Barrie, will for a long time survive their authors.</p>

<p>Among the novels, I do not know of any that
has or ought to have a better chance for the
future than the books written about the family
of the Forsytes by John Galsworthy. They at
present hold about the same place in contemporary
English literature as is held in France by
Romain Rolland’s <cite>Jean Christophe</cite>. Both are
works of great length which reflect with remarkable
accuracy the political, social, commercial,
artistic life and activity of the twentieth century,
the one in England, the other on the Continent.</p>

<p>Entirely apart from their appeal as good
novels, that is to say, apart from one’s natural
interest in the plot and in the characters, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
are social documents of great value. If the
future historian wishes to know English and
Continental society in the first quarter of the
twentieth century, he will do well to give attention
and reflexion to these two works of “fiction.”</p>

<p>John Galsworthy was just under forty when
in 1906 he published a novel called <cite>The Man of
Property</cite>. He had produced very little before
this, but it took no especial critical penetration
to discover that the new book was a masterpiece.
The family of the Forsytes bore a striking resemblance
to one another in basic traits and
ways of thinking, yet each was sharply individualised.
A new group of persons had been
added to British fiction. The word “Property,”
as in Tennyson’s <cite>Northern Farmer</cite>, was the keynote,
and before long it began to appear that one
of the most dramatic of contrasts was to be used
as the subject. This is the struggle between the
idea of Property and the idea of Beauty—between
the commercial, acquisitive temperament
and the more detached, but equally passionate
artistic temperament.</p>

<p>Even in the pursuit of beauty Mr. Soames
Forsyte never forgot the idea of property. He
was a first-class business man in the city, but he
was also an expert judge of paintings, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
added to his collection. Oil and canvas do not
completely satisfy any healthy business man;
so Soames added to his collection, as the masterpiece
in his gallery, an exquisitely beautiful
woman whom he made his wife.</p>

<p>The philosophy of love comes in here. What
is love? Is it exclusively the idea of possession,
which often is no more dignified than the predatory
instinct or is it the unalloyed wish that the
object of one’s love should be as happy and secure
as possible? No one can truly and sincerely
love Beauty either in the abstract or in
the concrete if one’s eyes are clouded by predatory
desire. One must look at beauty without
the wish to possess it if one is really to appreciate
beauty. A first-class French chef would
look into the big front window of a confectioner’s
shop and fully appreciate the art and taste that
created those delectable edibles; but a hungry
boy who looked at the same objects would not
appreciate them critically at all.</p>

<p>The wife of Soames finds him odious, so odious
that we cannot altogether acquit her of guilt in
marrying him; and Soames, who as a Man of
Property expected her to fulfill her contract, did
not make himself more physically attractive by
insisting on his rights. She left him for a man
of exactly the opposite temperament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>When Mr. Galsworthy finished this fine novel,
he had no intention of going on with the history
of the family. He wrote many other novels and
some remarkable plays, but nothing made the
impression on readers that had been produced
by the Forsyte family. Nearly twenty years
later he returned to the theme, and at once his
power as a novelist seemed to rise; there is something
in this family that calls out his highest
powers. When he discovered that he had written
five works of fiction on the Forsytes, three
long novels and two short stories, of which the
brief interlude called <cite>Indian Summer of a Forsyte</cite>
is an impeccable and I hope imperishable
work of art, he hit upon the happy idea of assembling
them into one prose epic, and calling the
whole thing by the ironical title of <cite>The Forsyte
Saga</cite>. It is my belief that for many years
to come the name of John Galsworthy will be
associated with this work, in what I fervently
hope will be its expanded form.</p>

<p>For since the assembling of the five pieces
Mr. Galsworthy has published several other
novels dealing with the family—<cite>The White
Monkey</cite>, <cite>The Silver Spoon</cite> and in 1928 he wrote
FINIS with <cite>Swan Song</cite>. Here he kills Soames,
and while he probably does not feel quite so sad
as Thackeray felt when he killed Colonel Newcome,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
I venture to say that he does not gaze on
the corpse of Soames with indifferent eyes. For
to my mind the most interesting single feature
of this whole mighty epic is the development of
the character of this man.</p>

<p>Clyde Fitch used to say something that is no
doubt true of many works of the imagination;
he said that he would carefully plan a play,
write his first act, and definitely decide what the
leading characters should say and do in the subsequent
portions of the work. Then these provokingly
independent characters seemed to acquire,
not only an independent existence, but a
power of will so strong that they insisted on
doing and saying all kinds of things which he
tried in vain to prevent.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Man of Property</cite> Soames Forsyte is a
repulsive character; he is hated by his wife, by
the reader, and by the author. But in these
later books Soames becomes almost an admirable
person, and we may say of him at the end in
reviewing his life, that nothing became him
like the leaving of it—for he died nobly. Long
before this catastrophe, however, we have
learned to admire, respect, and almost to love
Soames. Is it possible that Mr. Galsworthy
had any notion of this spiritual progress when
he wrote <cite>The Man of Property</cite>, or is it that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
living so long with Soames he began to see his
good points?</p>

<p>Dickens was a master in this kind of development.
When we first meet Mr. Pickwick, he
seems like the president of a service club as
conceived by Sinclair Lewis; he is the butt of the
whole company. Later Mr. Pickwick develops
into a noble and magnanimous gentleman, whom
every right-minded person loves. Look at Dick
Swiveller—when we first see him, he is no more
than a guttersnipe. He develops into a true
knight.</p>

<span class="subhead">PROFESSION AND PRACTICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Beautiful lines which show that the man who
wrote them had a clear conception of true religion
are these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And even his failings leaned to virtue’s side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But in his duty prompt at every call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He watched and wept, he prayed and felt for all;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, as a bird each fond endearment tries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The man who wrote them is thus described by
James Boswell: “Those who were in any way
distinguished excited envy in him to so ridiculous
an excess that the instances of it are hardly
credible. When accompanying two beautiful
young ladies with their mother on a tour of
France, he was seriously angry that more attention
was paid to them than to him.” Goldsmith
wrote of virtue, modesty, sweet unselfishness in
the most convincing manner; his words were
more convincing than his behaviour. He allured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
to brighter worlds, but did not lead the
way.</p>

<p>Schopenhauer, the great philosopher of pessimism,
taught that absolute asceticism was the
only true religion and method of escape from the
ills of life; but he never practiced it, and told his
disciples to mind his precepts and not his example.
Unfortunately, whenever any one gives
advice in the field of morality or religion, the
first person on whom we test its practical value
is the preacher. Emerson remarked, “What you
are thunders so loud I cannot hear what you
say.”</p>

<p>No great writer of modern times has written
more persuasively of the Christian way of life
than Tolstoi; there is no doubt that his stories
and tracts have had an immense influence on
millions of readers and have inspired them toward
unselfishness, kindness and humility. But
of all great Russian writers, Tolstoi himself was
the most difficult to get along with; he could not
bear to hear any other writer praised and was
lacking in the grace of appreciation. His rival,
Turgenev, who had no religious belief of any
kind, excelled Tolstoi in the virtues of modesty,
unselfishness and consideration for others.</p>

<p>One of the many reasons why the art of bringing
up children is the most difficult of all arts is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
that it is essential for parents to set a daily example.
All the moral precepts in the world will
not seriously impress children if their parents
do not in their daily life come somewhere near
the ideals they hold up. The child will after a
fashion love his parents anyhow, but as he grows
older and begins to compare what he has been
taught with what he sees, the child is transformed
into a judge. This partly explains that
fear of their own children which so many parents
secretly feel.</p>

<p>If the parents make their small children go to
church and stay home themselves, the children
quite naturally regard church-going as one of
the numerous penalties imposed on youth and
look forward to maturity as an escape from this
and many other unpleasant compulsions. If
parents impress on their children the necessity
of telling the truth, they must not themselves
tell lies; they are being watched by the sharpest
eyes in the world.</p>

<p>Although in a certain sense we are all hypocrites—for
no one can live up to his ideals—we
hate any flagrant case of hypocrisy. I suppose
one reason we have a sneaking admiration for
pirates is that pirates are not hypocrites. There
is no doubt that professional pirates are more
generally admired than professional politicians.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
I do not say that politicians are hypocrites; I say
that pirates are not.</p>

<p>It is the personalities of great leaders, much
more than their sayings, that have had a beneficial
influence. The sayings of Jesus—every
word that has come down to us—can be read
through in three hours. But from His life and
character flows a vital force, tremendously effective
after nineteen centuries. Very few
people read the literary compositions of Sir
Philip Sidney, but millions have been influenced
by his life and character. The pure, unselfish
life of George Herbert is more efficacious than
his poems; and consider Saint Francis!</p>

<p>The Christian Church has had in every century
of its existence able, honest, determined
foes, who have done their best to destroy it; it is
probable that they have done it no injury. Nor
have the frank sensualists and materialists hurt
it at all. It has been injured only by its professed
friends.</p>

<p>If a physician opens an office, his most dangerous
foes are not his competitors, that is to
say, other doctors; his most dangerous foes are
those of his patients who say, “Well, I took his
medicine, and it did me no good.” The best advertising
is done by one’s sincere friends and admirers;
the good word about the new doctor, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
the new novel, or the new play, is passed
along.</p>

<p>The Christian religion professes to make those
who accept it better and happier; every one who
professes it and exhibits none of its graces is a
powerful argument against its validity. A
man’s foes are those of his own household.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think religion should first of all
show itself in good manners; that is, in true politeness,
consideration for others, kindness and
deference without servility. Such persons are
those we love to meet and be with; they are
good advertisements of their religion; they will
not have to talk about it because its effects are
so plainly and attractively seen.</p>

<span class="subhead">LONDON AS A SUMMER RESORT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I had an interesting conversation with Bernard
Shaw last week. The next day he and Mrs.
Shaw were leaving to spend the summer on the
Riviera, which from time immemorial has been
regarded as a winter resort. He gave, as is his
custom, an original and diverting explanation
of the fact that many now prefer to visit winter
resorts in the summer. It is a matter of clothes.
The Victorians were forced to go to cool places,
or at any rate to avoid warm places; because
they were compelled to wear stuffy clothes, the
men being encased in frock coats, thick waistcoats,
collars and swaddling neckcloths. But
today, when one leaves off almost everything,
the finest place in the world, according to G.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.,
is a climate where one can live outdoors in
comfort, day and night.</p>

<p>It is certainly true that many European resorts,
where the hotels used to be open only during
a short winter season, now attract visitors
the year round. The converse is also true. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
can well remember when the great hotels of
Switzerland—the playground of Europe—were
open only during the summer; and were crowded
only during the month of August. But now
they never close and are as much sought after in
December and January as in the good old summertime.
The same is true of Lake Placid in
America and of many other places. People in
Victorian times were forced to dress according
to the prevailing style, which bore no reference
to climate or common sense; remember how
the women used to look, playing golf and
tennis!</p>

<p>Furthermore the old idea that everyone who
could afford it must leave the city during the
“heated term” has become obsolete, even in
America. President Harper of the University
of Chicago established a Summer Quarter, and
professors who wished to do so could take their
three months’ vacation in the winter, a privilege
that many continue to enjoy. The Country
clubs and golf have had much to do with the contentment
of business men who remain in cities
during the summer. As a matter of fact, the
city is not at all a bad place, I mean, of course,
for those who can afford to make themselves
comfortable.</p>

<p>The city of Munich has for many years been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
a Mecca for summer pilgrims. The season of
music, arranged for foreign visitors, reaches its
climax in August. Now I wish to urge the millions
of Americans who at one time or another
cross the ocean to consider the merits of London
as a summer resort.</p>

<p>For over a hundred years July has been a part
of the London “season”; Parliament is in session,
operas and theatres are open, and parties
flourish amain. The twelfth of August, the
opening of the grouse shooting season, is the
formal beginning of the vacation; Parliament
always adjourns for it, and London society flies
north. But to an American London is day by
day interesting, and there should be no closing
of any season for him.</p>

<p>London has no prolonged hot weather, like St.
Louis. It has been said that the English climate
consists of eight months of winter, and
four months of bad weather. This is an exaggeration.
Every now and then there is a year
when summer is omitted; but even in such an
unfortunate time, one is better off in London
than in the country. In fact, to an American
London, while not the most beautiful city in the
world, is assuredly the most interesting. It is
inexhaustible. Every foot of it, to one well read
in English literature, is hallowed ground; I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
I could walk along Fleet street a thousand days
in succession, and always receive a thrill.</p>

<p>I wish that every American journalist, every
American book reviewer, every American drama
critic, would spend a month in London and diligently
read the morning newspapers, such as
<cite>The Times</cite>, <cite>The Telegraph</cite>, <cite>The Morning Post</cite>.
Every page seems to be written for intelligent
readers. These London journalists review tennis,
golf and cricket matches with more dignity
than the average New Yorker reviews plays and
books. One reason that militates steadily
against intellectual progress in America is the
fact that apparently we have no language suitable
as a medium for the exchange of ideas.
Our book reviews and our drama criticisms are
too often written in a cheap kind of slang that is
intended to be smart. If anyone imagines that
the journalism of London loses in intensity by
being written in suitable English, let him turn
to a file of <cite>The London Times</cite> and read the story
of Tilden playing tennis at Wimbledon.</p>

<p>A remarkable thing about literary society in
London is that age has nothing to do with it.
One meets in social gatherings men and women
in the twenties and in the eighties—disparity
in years seems to be forgotten.</p>

<p>One should remember that, owing to the small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
size of England, one can use London as a base of
operations and take excursions into the country
on the swift English trains, returning to London
every evening; many happy, baggageless days
have I spent in this manner.</p>

<p>When G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton was in America, I
asked him what difference between the two
countries impressed him most. Instantly he replied,
“Your wooden houses.” I had never
thought of them as curiosities, but one does not
see them in England. The thing that to me is
most noticeable on the London streets is the absence
of straw hats. There are many more bare
male heads than there are straw hats. It is almost
impossible to attract attention in London,
but a straw hat will come nearest to doing the
trick. Some men are exquisitely and others
strangely clad, and nobody cares. I saw a man
riding a bicycle. He had on tan shoes, homespun
trousers, a frock coat, and a tall silk hat.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT THE MAN WILL WEAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Men, women, and children are all interested
in clothes; there have been many scholarly
works, displaying vast erudition, on the history
of costume; and two literary masterpieces, dealing
with the philosophy of clothes, belong permanently
to literature—<cite>A Tale of a Tub</cite>, by
Jonathan Swift, and <cite>Sartor Resartus</cite>, by Thomas
Carlyle.</p>

<p>So much attention has recently been paid in
the newspapers and by the public to the clothes
of women, that we are forgetting what revolutionary
changes have taken place in the garments
of men. Women’s clothes have decreased
in number, weight, and size. Men’s clothes
have gone through a process of <em>softening</em>. Hard
hats, hard collars, hard shirts, hard shoes, hard
suits, have given way to soft; and, for the first
time in centuries, the carcasses of males are comfortably
clad.</p>

<p>One hundred years ago the average gentleman,
not satisfied with covering his body with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
an accumulation of intolerably thick clothes,
wound an enormous stock around his neck.
How stifling they look in those old family portraits!
Robert Louis Stevenson applied an unexpected
but accurate adjective to those collections
of oil paintings of deceased ancestors, with
which their descendants adorned walls of their
dining rooms. Stevenson called them “these
constipated portraits.”</p>

<p>This is the way my father dressed on practically
every morning of his life; that is, after he
left the farm, and entered upon the practice of
his profession. He wore long, heavy flannel
underwear, reaching to his ankles and his wrists.
He put on a “hard-boiled,” white, full-bosomed
shirt, stiff as sheet-iron. At the neck he fastened
a stiff, upright, white linen choker collar;
at the ends of the sleeves he buttoned on thick,
three-ply linen cuffs. He imprisoned his feet,
ankles, and shins in black, stiff, leather boots,
reaching to the knees, but concealed above the
ankles by his trousers. He wore a long-tailed
coat, a waistcoat, and trousers made out of thick,
dark-blue or black broadcloth. The trousers
were strapped over his shoulders by suspenders.
For the top of his head there was a tall, heavy,
beaver hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span></p>

<p>Thus, clad in impenetrable armour from head
to foot, he set out for the day’s work.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago was the age of dressing-gown
and slippers. Why is it we never hear slippers
mentioned nowadays? I have not owned a pair
of slippers (except bedroom slippers) for more
than thirty years. Yet in Victorian novels we
are always reading of how, when the breadwinner
returns to his home in the evening, he
finds his slippers ready for him, warmed on the
hearth. My father always took off his great
boots—worn in summer as well as in winter—and
put on his slippers when he came home,
having called it a day.</p>

<p>Poets, novelists, and men whose occupation
kept them at home, sat down to their desk in
dressing-gown and slippers. The moment a
man sat down in his own house to anything, with
no immediate thought of going out, dressing-gown
and slippers were the regulation costume.
They were like knights-at-arms, taking off their
suits of mail when they entered the interior of
the castle.</p>

<p>Eventually the knee-boots gave way to high
shoes—called boots in England—which were
laced up to the top. In time these were succeeded
by low shoes, which are now worn by
millions of Americans the year round.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>The swaddling, stifling, heavy underclothes
were scrapped, and their place taken by sleeveless,
shinless undergarments, light in weight, and
more or less open in texture. Best of all, the intolerable
stiff shirt, the bottom edge of which
cut into the abdomen, and bellied out above like
a sail in a fair wind, was reserved only for formal
evening wear; shirts were made and worn that
had no trace of starch in front, back, collar or
cuff. I have not worn a stiff shirt (except for
evening) in twenty years.</p>

<p>Suspenders (braces) became obsolete; and the
pleasant belt came in, the belt that may be
loosened or tightened at will, and which in any
case leaves the shoulders free. In hot weather
the waistcoat was discarded; and the man in his
thin, loose clothes moved about almost as easily
as Adam in Paradise.</p>

<p>Various are the names for the round stiff hat,
derby, dicer, pot hat, bowler, billy-cock. Under
any name it is just as bad. Some fifteen or
twenty years ago the derby went temporarily
out of fashion. Up to that time, if you looked
into a cloak-room by a hotel dining-room, you
saw about two hundred men’s hats looking
exactly alike. Now you see a vast assortment
of soft headgear, grey, brown, green, all of pleasing
shape. The thousands of men at a football<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
game now show variety aloft, instead of the intolerable
black monotony of former years. I
have not owned a “derby” since the war. Apart
from my own hatred of the object, I always
crushed it getting in or out of an automobile.
And one indentation ruins a derby forever:
every wound is mortal.</p>

<p>I am quite aware that the derby is returning.
Everyone knows the nation-wide fame acquired
by a certain brown derby. But no stiff hat,
black or brown, will ever adorn my brows again
during the hours of daylight.</p>

<p>The English, owing to their horrible climate
and also partly to an invincible conservatism,
still wear heavy clothes, thicksoled high shoes,
braces, waistcoats, etc., even in hot weather.
The only reform they have made is discarding
the frock coat for daily wear, which up to a very
few years ago was universal. A common sight
in London was to see clerks going to the “city”
on bicycles, arrayed in “Prince Albert” coats.</p>

<p>The clothes of an American tourist still look
funny to an Englishman; how funny I never
realised until I attended a play in London where
an American was the object of good-natured
caricature. He came on the stage with low
shoes and silk shoe-laces, bright, thin socks,
trousers held by a belt, no waistcoat, and jacket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
unbuttoned. The audience burst into roars of
laughter and I laughed too, because he did look
queer by contrast with the other actors. Then
I suddenly realised that I was dressed precisely
like the man they were laughing at!</p>

<p>One more reform must be made in men’s dress;
and I believe it will come. In very hot weather,
men must be allowed to discard the jacket.
Even a thin jacket, with its collar and shouldercloth,
is intolerable. A clean, attractive shirt,
with soft collar and necktie, and belt around the
trousers, looks so sensible in hot weather that it
ought to become the rule rather than the exception.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_146">XXVII<br>

<span class="subhead">DREAMS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I look upon horrible dreams as one of the assets
of humanity, one of the good things of life;
because one feels so elated after waking. I am
convinced that most men and women do not
sufficiently appreciate the advantages they possess.
They either exaggerate their sufferings
and drawbacks or, instead of enjoying what they
have, they spend their time in longing for what
is beyond their reach.</p>

<p>Just as it takes an illness to make one appreciate
the satisfactions of health, so one needs
a calamity to make one realise how good daily
existence really is. It is often said that experience
is the best teacher. This is by no means
always or even often true. Experience charges
too much for her lessons.</p>

<p>There is no good in learning how one might
have shown sagacity in business after one is
bankrupt; there is no good in discovering how
one ought to have avoided a certain article of
diet after one is fatally poisoned; there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
good in receiving the proof of the danger in carelessly
driving a motor car after one lies dead in
the ditch.</p>

<p>Now the best way to discover how cheerful
daily life may be is to be visited by a frightful
dream. The horrible wild beast has seized us,
because when we tried to flee, our legs were
lead. Just as it is about to sink its terrible tusks
in our shrinking frame, we wake up, and hear the
good old trolley car go by. Hurrah! it was only
a dream; and we are alive on the blessed earth.
And we have learned how sweet plain ordinary
life is without the lesson costing us anything
but a transitory sweat.</p>

<p>I think, too, that many who either profess to
hate life or at all events refuse to admit anything
good about it, might appreciate it more if
they could be temporarily transferred, not to
hell, but to their own imagined heaven. Wagner
in the famous music-drama, <cite>Tannhäuser</cite>,
has given an admirable illustration. This
knight, like all his fellow-creatures, felt the call
of the senses; he was transported from this imperfect
earth to the pagan Heaven, where he
lived in the constant society of Venus. But
after a time this palled upon him and eventually
became intolerable. He tore himself away, and
suddenly found himself back on the earth. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
was in a green pasture in the springtime, and a
shepherd boy was singing—what happiness!</p>

<p>The accomplished German dramatist Ludwig
Fulda wrote a play, <cite>Schlaraffenland</cite>. There
was a poor boy, ragged, cold and chronically hungry.
He dreamed he was in a magic land. Remarkable
birds flew so slowly by him that he
found he could reach out his hand and grasp
them. He did this, and lo, he had in his hand a
broiled chicken! He ate several with avidity,
but could not eat forever. Glancing at his
ragged garments, a wardrobe door flew wide, and
he had his choice among many elegant suits.
Thus every desire was instantly and abundantly
gratified. After some time, this palled upon
him, and then became so unendurable that he
gave a yell of horror; he woke up. He was cold,
ragged, and hungry; but his heart was singing.
He was back on the good old earth.</p>

<p>Thus, whether we dream of hell or of heaven,
it is usually with a sigh or even a shout of satisfaction
that we find ourselves back on this imperfect
globe.</p>

<p>Many persons tell me that they never dream;
their sleep is blank. It is with me quite otherwise;
I almost always dream; many of my
dreams are extraordinarily vivid and some are
unforgettable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>When I was a child I dreamed three nights in
succession of the Devil. The first night the
Devil chased me upstairs. I ran as fast as I
could, but sank down when only half way up.
Then the Devil took from his pocket a shoemaker’s
awl and bored it deftly into my right
knee. The second night the Devil was in my
front yard. Suddenly he changed into the
form of a dog; and when another dog rushed
barking at him the satanic hound swallowed
him as easily as one takes a pill. The third night
I also dreamed of the Devil, but I have forgotten
the details.</p>

<p>One of the worst dreams I had in childhood
was when I was being attacked by wild beasts,
and suddenly my mother appeared on the scene.
I shrieked to her for help, and she looked at me
with calm indifference. That was the worst
dream I ever had, and you may be sure it went
by contraries.</p>

<p>I suppose the only way we can distinguish
dreams from what is called actual life is that in
dreams the law of causation is suspended.
There is no order in events, and no principle of
sufficient reason to account for them. Things
change in an impossible manner. Apart from
this, dreams are as real as life while they last.</p>

<p>I often have prolonged dreams that are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
only fully as real as waking experiences, but are
orderly and sensible, and sometimes delightful.
Many years ago I dreamed that I was walking
the streets of a Russian city with Count Tolstoi.
It was one of the most agreeable and most inspiring
days of my life, and I have always
regretted it never happened. We walked together
for hours and discussed modern literature.
He said a great many wise and brilliant
things, all of which I have, alas, forgotten. The
only feature of that dream unlike reality was
that Tolstoi had shaved off his beard.</p>

<p>Wilkie Collins, in <cite>Armadale</cite>, suggested that
every dream we have is a repetition of an experience
that has actually happened to us during
the preceding twenty-four hours. I read
that novel in my boyhood and was impressed by
that explanation of dreams, and for several
months I wrote down my dreams and found that
every one was suggested by something that had
happened to me during the preceding day.</p>

<p>The only thing I am certain of in dreams is
that they do not in any way forecast the future.
When I was a child I dreamed I saw heaven
and Jesus sitting on a cloud. He called to me,
“Willie Phelps, come here.” The next day I
told my father and mother about it, and to my
surprise they were exceedingly alarmed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_151">XXVIII<br>

<span class="subhead">EATING BREAKFAST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the daily life of the average person the
longest interval between eating is that between
the evening meal and breakfast; the very name
for the morning repast accurately describes its
nature. It should therefore, be taken seriously,
which means that there should not only be
enough to eat, but that plenty of time should be
allowed to eat it.</p>

<p>I am aware that there are many men of excellent
character who eat almost nothing for
breakfast, and that there are some saints who
eat no breakfast at all. In character and personal
habits, I have never met a man more
saintly than Henry Ford. I refer both to the
asceticism of his physical life and to the purity
of the motives that inspire his conduct. He
eats no breakfast at all, not a morsel of food.
He rises very early, goes outdoors, runs a mile or
two and then works with absolute concentration
till one o’clock, when he has the first meal of the
day. I asked him if he never felt any desire for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
food during so long a morning; he replied that
it was necessary for him in his vast undertakings
to have a mind entirely fresh and clear, and
that he found he could do better work on an
empty stomach and with a brain unclouded by
food.</p>

<p>I suppose every man must be a law unto himself.
It does not seem to me that I could live
happily without breakfast, yet I am sure that it
is better to omit the meal altogether than to eat
it in the hurry and fever in which many Americans
devour it. Far too many prefer to lie in
bed half an hour longer than to use that precious
half hour in the consumption of food.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the days when they had required morning
chapel at Yale a great many students came to
chapel either without any breakfast or with unassorted
junks of it in their stomachs engaged
in civil war. One early morning I was walking
up Elm Street in New Haven; the streets ware
filled with undergraduates sprinting to chapel.
The lady with me said: “Do look at those poor
boys running to chapel with their tongues hanging
out!” I set her right at once. “Those are
not tongues, those are griddle cakes!”</p>

<p>Those young men were accurate calculators.
Three minutes for breakfast, one minute to reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
chapel. They hurried the last griddle cake into
their faces as they left the dining hall, and it
gradually disappeared as they ran.</p>

<p>I love to see the whole family assemble at
breakfast and eat a good meal leisurely. In
order to accomplish this, every one must get up
early enough to allow for complete preparation
in the way of bathing, shaving, etc., and then
leave enough time to consume food in peace of
mind. Of how many families is this true? Of
course, there are many persons who like to eat
breakfast in bed, and perhaps, there are some
who can do this neatly, even artistically. I
never eat breakfast in bed unless I am too sick to
get up, for I hate to have crumbs all over my
night clothes or inside the bed. Furthermore,
in spite of considerable practice during various
illnesses, I have never mastered the fine art of
swallowing food while in a horizontal position.
To take coffee in this manner is an achievement.
And what is breakfast without coffee?</p>

<p>Although coffee is not an American product,
I have never had a satisfactory cup of coffee outside
of the United States of America. Americans
alone seem to understand the secret of
good coffee. The English meet this problem
illegitimately, by substituting tea. Now tea
is all very well in the late afternoon, but in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
morning it is without inspiration. And every
man ought to start the day in an inspired manner.</p>

<p>G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton says that Bernard Shaw is
like coffee; he stimulates but does not inspire.
I should amend that, by saying Shaw is like
coffee because he stimulates but does not nourish.
For I firmly believe that both Shaw and
coffee are alike in this: they do both stimulate
and inspire, but they do not nourish. I used to
wonder what Chesterton could possibly mean
by saying that coffee did not inspire, when suddenly
the true explanation occurred to me. He
was thinking of English coffee.</p>

<p>The newspaper should not be read during the
sacred rite of breakfast. There is no doubt that
many divorces have been caused by the man’s
opening and reading the newspaper at breakfast,
thereby totally eclipsing his wife. It is
simply a case of bad manners, and bad manners
at food have in thousands of instances extinguished
the fires of love. Nor, although it is a
common custom, do I believe that letters should
be opened and read at the breakfast table. One
letter may contain enough worry, disappointment
and anger to upset a reader for hours.
And to eat food while one is angry, or worried,
or excited is almost as bad as eating poison. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
never read letters at breakfast and I never read
letters in the evening.</p>

<p>For the same reason breakfast should be
eaten in a calm and peaceful state of mind, illuminated
by happy family conversation.
Many men every day eat breakfast in feverish
haste and then run to catch a trolley car or a
train. That horrible breakfast soon begins to
assert itself, and the man is in an irritable condition
all the morning. It simply does not pay to
eat in a hurry. Breakfast should not resemble
a delirium.</p>

<p>And at the breakfast table all the members of
the party should eat or leave the room. It is a
sad experience to be in a hotel or in a dining
car and have some acquaintance come up briskly
and say: “I have already had my breakfast, but
I will sit and talk with you while you eat yours.”
That means he intends to watch you eat, and,
just as your mouth is full of food, he will ask you
a question. I have observed many patient men
suffering tortures in this manner. I have even
observed an enormous mass of unchewed food
distend their throats as they hastily bolt it in the
endeavor to reply to interrogations. A snake
may swallow a toad, but the snake’s constitution
differs from a man’s.</p>

<p>If I could have only one meal a day, it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
be breakfast. After a good American breakfast—orange
juice, cereal, coffee, toast, bacon and
eggs—I am ready for everything and anything.
If the day begins in the right manner its progress
will be satisfactory. And the best of all
rules of diet is to eat what you like and take the
time to do it.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MOTHER TONGUE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Judges xii:6—“Then said they unto him, Say
now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he
could not frame to pronounce it right. Then
they took him, and slew him at the passages of
Jordan: and there fell at that time of the
Ephraimites forty and two thousand.”</p>

<p>If there were forty-two thousand of the sons
of Ephraim who could not speak correctly and
distinctly, we may be sure that the sons and
daughters of America are not impeccable. Indeed,
we have daily evidence not only on the
street and in railway coaches, but in schools,
churches, colleges and theatres, of linguistic
matricide—mortal attacks on the mother
tongue, committed with impunity in the absence
of the axe. In Old Testament times they
had, as we see by the text of this sermon, drastic
methods for establishing correct standards of
pronunciation; those who did not speak accurately
were eliminated.</p>

<p>Besides the suffering inflicted on sensitive and
sympathetic ears, there is a feeling of shame in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
the heart of this present evangelist that the
American public school, which ought to be a
temple where the English language is treated
with reverence, should actually be a scene of
cynical—since everything careless is cynical—desecration.
I am not condemning colloquial
slang, which in its metaphorical picturesqueness
is often the very life of speech, but rather the
shoddy mutilation of words in good and regular
standing.</p>

<p>More important than the study of foreign
tongues is the unaffectedly correct pronunciation
of that language which is now heard in the
uttermost parts of the earth. Furthermore, the
very difficulties of English pronunciation make
the successful surmounting of them a glorious
achievement, one that should appeal to the
Spirit of Youth, which instinctively loves a desperate
undertaking.</p>

<p>German is practically a phonetic language;
leaving out the matter of accent, it is easier for
an American, with proper instruction, to speak
German words correctly than it is for him to
conquer the wild and lawless army of English
syllables. Let us then not minimise the
strength of the foe; let this rather become an
inspiration.</p>

<p>Let me say two things to all school and college<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
teachers: No matter what subject you teach,
Greek, chemistry or physics, whenever you hear
one of your pupils mispronounce an English
word correct him so that he and the other members
of the class will learn something valuable
there and then. And when you do this, tell the
class that if any member of it hears you mispronounce
a word, you will be grateful for immediate
and public correction.</p>

<p>Second, do not allow any pupil to speak better
English than that spoken by you. Our schools
and colleges contain a few pupils who speak the
language so well that they beat the teacher; the
teacher should not permit such a thing to continue.
Although I was brought up in a cultivated
home, I learned in my boyhood a considerable
number of bad pronunciations; I changed
these for better ones because I was determined
that no one of my students should speak more
correctly than I.</p>

<p>Bernard Shaw told me he was on a special
committee appointed to standardise English
pronunciation in Great Britain; this committee,
consisting of a very few, tell all the radio broadcasters
exactly how to pronounce a long list of
words, in the hope that by this means the millions
“listening in” will learn how to speak their
own language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>There is no reason why Americans should
imitate the British in the pronunciation of certain
words which the cultivated citizens of both
countries pronounce quite differently—I refer
to words like <em>schedule</em>, <em>clerk</em>, <em>capitalist</em>, <em>trait</em>,
<em>fracas</em>, <em>lieutenant</em> and the last letter in the alphabet
which Shakespeare calls by a bad name.</p>

<p>It is sheer affectation to imitate the British in
such special matters, as it is an affectation to
imitate what is called the Oxford accent, where
the word smoke is pronounced as if it were
spelled smilk—see Julian Street’s delightful
book <cite>In Need of Change</cite>. Yesterday afternoon
I heard an English actress on the New York
stage pronounce No as if it were spelled NAAO.
But after all, England is the home of the English
speech; and I wish that it were possible for the
United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
Capetown and other places to follow in general
the best English spelling and pronunciation.
For example, it is certainly better for Americans
to pronounce the word been like the sacred vegetable
of Boston than like the first syllable of the
Christian name of Franklin.</p>

<p>In America the most shamefully treated of
our five vowels is U, and the combination of letters
EW, which should resemble U in accuracy,
as it now so often does in sin. There should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
a distinct difference between the sound of U and
the double O, actually observable to the naked
ear in such words as Duke, Duty, Tutor, Constitution,
Enthusiasm, Tuesday, News.</p>

<p>The way to make this distinction is to remember
that the English language is the only one
where the true sound of U is YU; whereas the
Russians, Italians and Germans pronounce U
like OO, and the French differently from any
one of these. Just as the Russians pronounce
E as if it were YE, so Americans, when they
practice in secret words like evolution, should
visualize a Y in front of the U; it will help
them.</p>

<p>The most popular letter in our alphabet, E, is
abominably treated in such words as cellar, yellow,
Philadelphia, where it is so offensively given
the sound of U in “skull”; this is even more common
and still more unpleasant in two useful
words, Very and American.</p>

<p>Cultivated English and Americans laugh at
the Cockney for leaving the H silent where it
should be heard; but they themselves are equally
and more unpardonably guilty in omitting the
H in the combination Wh. There should be a
difference in the pronunciation of <em>Whine</em> and
<em>Wine</em>; yet most cultivated people in both countries
talk about games of Wist, and say Wen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
Wich and Wy. Let them heal themselves before
laughing at the Cockney.</p>

<p>The dogletter, R, has a curious fate in American
mouths; it is either unduly accented in such
words as Here and Dinner (Middle West) or it is
(East) hitched on to the end of words like idea,
and saw, where it is as awkward as a sailor on
horseback. Listen to the average Yankee when
he says “I have no idea of it” and you will see
that he speaks the truth.</p>

<span class="subhead">OUR SOUTH AS CURE FOR FLU</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The chief reason for my present sojourn at
Augusta is the flu, which attacked me in Connecticut
some weeks ago. The American use
of the words “flu” and “grip” is both modern
and interesting. Epidemics of influenza, which
seem to cross the ocean from Europe to America
without suffering any sea-change, have been
more or less common since the pilgrims landed
at Plymouth. Richard Hildreth, in his admirable
<cite>History of the United States</cite>, describes
these attacks in the Massachusetts Colony in
the seventeenth century; and it appears from
his realistic accounts that they differed in no respect
from recent nation-wide flu epidemics.</p>

<p>If I remember rightly, the word “grip” was
not used currently in America until the epidemic
of 1889–1890, which was both severe and
general; it was the subject of constant discussion
in the newspapers, and it was generally
believed to be a French importation, where it
was known as <i lang="fr">la grippe</i>. This in American became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the “grip,” except in certain isolated districts,
where it was called “the la grippe.” But
the word, either in its French or English form,
was not commonly used in America until the
season of 1889–1890, when France made a
Christmas present of it to the United States.</p>

<p>The word “flu” had been British slang for
some time before it penetrated America; it was
one of the numerous unprofitable things that
our country acquired during the war. In a conversation
I had with the novelist, William De
Morgan, in London, in 1911, he casually used the
word “flu,” and for a moment I did not guess its
meaning. Then I saw it was an abbreviation.
When the disease crossed the ocean in 1918, it
brought with it its British pet name, which, universally
current in America today, was, I believe,
not known here till the last year of the war.</p>

<p>The exact difference between flu and grip I
leave to the physician to determine; both differ
from a cold in being invariably accompanied by
fever, and in both the patient feels the worst
after he gets well.</p>

<p>But the speed with which the germs travel
through the air remains a mystery. I remember
one flu epidemic that hit New York in the
morning and was prevalent in remote country
districts in Michigan the following afternoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Manifestly, therefore, the accursed thing does
not depend on the comparatively slow method
of transmission from one person to another.</p>

<p>If one can possibly afford the time and money,
the best way to rid oneself of the after effects of
the flu is to leave the icy North in winter time
and travel South. There are many coughs in
every carload, but soon after they arrive here
they cease.</p>

<p>In fact, if one can afford it, it is a good thing
to come South in winter whether one is sick or
well. “See America First” applies especially
to the winter season. Europe should be visited
only in the summer, because no Americans are
comfortable in Europe at any other time.
George Ade once tried to spend a winter in
Venice and he nearly froze. He declared that
the next winter he would spend in Duluth,
where they have steam heat and he could keep
warm.</p>

<p>The intolerable thing about most “winter
resorts” in Europe is that they are so much
warmer outdoors than in. The American takes
a pleasant walk in the mild sunshine, and, his
body in an agreeable glow, he enters his hotel
room which has the chill of the grave. I know
one man who, whenever he entered his room,
put on overcoat, fur hat, gloves, arctic overshoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
and then sat down to be as comfortable as he
could.</p>

<p>One impecunious student who spent the winter
at a Continental university in a room where
apparently no means of heating had ever been
employed told me that he kept warm the entire
winter on only one stick of wood. In response
to my question, he said that his room was on the
fifth story; he would study for ten minutes, then
fling the stick out of the window. He ran down
five flights of stairs, picked up the stick, ran up
the stairs and found that this violent exercise
kept him warm for exactly ten minutes, when
again he flung the stick out of the window. That
was an original method, but it is practicable only
for those who are young and vigorous. It would
be almost useless for an old lady with angina
pectoris.</p>

<p>In the winter season our Southern States, or
Arizona, or California are what I especially prescribe.
For those who wish eternal summer
with all its pleasant heat and the delights of sea-bathing,
Southern Florida is the best; for those
who are middle-aged and elderly, who wish to
play golf and tennis, in crisp autumn-like
weather, Georgia is incomparable. Here in Augusta
the weather is frequently summer-hued;
on this blessed January day, for example, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
temperature is 78. But in general, the January
and February weather here is like mild October
in New England, with gentle days and keen
nights, good for sleep.</p>

<p>When I was young very few Northerners went
South in winter; all who could afford it went in
the summer to the mountains or the sea. But
today, when there are many ways of keeping
cool in the cities, and when the country club is
accessible every afternoon and evening, an immense
number of business men stay “on the job”
in the summer and take their vacation in the
winter.</p>

<p>A perfect climate in the winter lies only
twenty-four hours from New York. Furthermore,
it is an education for Northern men and
women who live in the South for a winter season
to become acquainted with our Southern
people, “whom to know is to love.” To me, a
down-East Yankee, it is a delight to meet these
charming, gracious men and women of the
South; and it is an especial delight to hear the
Southern accent, especially on the lips of lovely
women.</p>

<p>I wish I might live one hundred years from
now. Then, thanks to the men of science, every
year there will come a day in November when a
general notice will be given in our New England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
universities for every member of the faculty
and students to be indoors at a certain hour. At
the prescribed moment, all the dormitories, lecture
halls, offices and laboratories will rise majestically
in the air, carrying their human
freight. They will sail calmly South, and in a
few hours float gently down on a meadow in
Georgia or Florida, there to remain until the
middle of April.</p>

<span class="subhead">GOING TO CHURCH IN PARIS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There are not many Protestant churches in
Paris, because there are not many Protestants;
and of the vast throng of Americans who visit
Paris every summer, I suppose, comparatively
speaking, only a few go to church. The average
tourist does not visit Paris with the idea of entering
churches except as a sight-seer. Yet the
American Church of Paris with the Rev. Dr.
Joseph Wilson Cochran as pastor, is a flourishing
institution. The auditorium is filled every Sunday
morning, and the whole work of the church
in its Sunday school, Boy Scouts, classes for students,
charitable enterprises, etc., is so active and
successful that a new edifice has been found
necessary. They are erecting a fine church in a
splendid location on the Quai D’Orsay; the steel
frame is already in place and by another year
the building should be complete. Then there
is also the American Cathedral church of the
Holy Trinity, St. Luke’s Chapel, the Catholic
church of St. Joseph, the Methodist Memorial
church, the Baptist tabernacle, the First Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
of Christ Scientist, and the Second Church of
Christ Scientist.</p>

<p>Now I go to church not reluctantly, because
I think I ought to, or from any sense of duty,
still less from the Pharasaical attempt to set an
example to my less godly neighbours. I go to
church because I enjoy going, because I really
want to go, because the Christian church is my
spiritual home.</p>

<p>Last Sunday I attended the French Protestant
church of the Oratoire, in the rue St. Honoré.
The attitude of the clergy and laity in this
church is very similar to that of the Rev. Dr.
Harry Emerson Fosdick and his congregation in
New York. Last Sunday the big church was
well filled, and the services, with the single difference
that everything was in the French language,
were similar to those of any evangelical
Protestant church in America. There was no
ritual. The prayers were extempore, and among
the hymns sung was the familiar one with the
familiar tune, “Lord, I Hear of Showers of Blessing,”
which was just as good in French as in
English.</p>

<p>I felt that I was among my own people, the
kind with which I grew up, although there were
very few Americans present. The French audience
seemed to be composed of the same sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
that one sees in any Methodist or Baptist church
in America. The pastor preached on the parable
of the sower, and explained to the audience
the significance of the evangelical Protestant
church, as distinguished from the more formal
and ritualistic Catholic institution. The Catholics
provide beautiful music, a dignified ritual,
which is very impressive, he said; “but we appeal
not to the eye and the ear, but to the mind
and the heart.” I do not think he meant to be
antagonistic to the Catholics; he was trying to
make his congregation see that there was a good
reason for attending church, even though the
service might have little or no appeal to the
senses.</p>

<p>It was peculiarly interesting for me to hear
this aspect of religious worship emphasised, for
on the preceding Sunday in London I attended
service in an Anglo-Catholic church, where the
preacher was the Rev. T.&nbsp;P. Fry, the husband of
the famous novelist, Sheila Kaye-Smith. His
sermon emphasised only one thing, the Blessed
Sacrament. He dwelt on its supreme importance,
on its immense significance, of what it
should mean to every one who partakes of it.
The service was beautiful, with an elaborate
ritual, and it was clear that the preacher thought
of only one thing—the Mass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>The English novelist, Compton Mackenzie,
has recently written a trilogy of novels dealing
at great length and with much detail with the
life and career of a young English priest. Mr.
Mackenzie, like G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton and Maurice
Baring, has entered the Catholic church, and
while these three novels, <cite>The Altar Steps</cite>, <cite>The
Parson’s Progress</cite> and <cite>The Heavenly Ladder</cite>, are
frankly Catholic propaganda, I found them interesting
and valuable, because I was brought
up in the extreme Protestant point of view, and
it is important for me to hear and if possible to
understand something quite different. Mr.
Mackenzie’s young parson says that he does not
care if he never succeeds in preaching a good
sermon. His only interest is to give the congregation
the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p>An excellent Catholic lady once said to me,
“You do not understand our religion,” I answered,
“You must not say <em>religion</em>; your religion
is my religion. We have exactly the same
religion. What I do not fully understand is
your form of worship, the significance of the
various parts of your ritual.”</p>

<p>It is a matter of great rejoicing that the old
antagonism between Catholics and Protestants
has so largely disappeared. It is unfortunate
that any irritation or misunderstanding should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
remain. In a world so full of vice, so full of
scepticism, and above all so full of indifference
to religion, there should be not the slightest
shade of hostility between adherents of Christianity.
We should not be divided in the presence
of implacable foes.</p>

<p>A magnificent example of the true Christian
spirit was given at the beginning of this century
by one of the greatest men of modern times,
Pope Leo XIII. He publicly offered prayer for
the restoration to health of Queen Victoria of
England. When one thinks of the historic antagonism,
that was a noble and truly religious
act.</p>

<p>Once in the cathedral at Cologne, during
Mass, I sat between a devout German Catholic
and an American tourist. The German bowed,
knelt, crossed himself; the American used a pair
of opera glasses, as if he were at a spectacular
play. I should like to have given to my countryman
a little pamphlet written by a Catholic
priest, called <cite>What Are They Doing at the Altar?</cite>
so that he might have understood what was going
on, and at least have shown some reverence.</p>

<p>There is one important thing that we Protestants
ought to learn from our Catholic friends.
Many Protestants go to church just to hear a
sermon, and if the preacher is in bad form that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
morning, they feel disappointed, almost aggrieved,
as if they had gone to the movies and
the pictures happened to be poor.</p>

<p>Going to church ought not to be merely passive;
to go and see if the minister can entertain
us. It should be a community service,
where the audience participates and where
spiritual refreshment and stimulation may be
obtained. If we go to church merely to hear a
popular preacher, then we might as well stay at
home and read a popular book. The feeling of
actual participation is the supreme need of the
Protestant church today; not more clever
preachers, but a genuine hunger in the congregation
for spiritual nourishment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_175">XXXII<br>

<span class="subhead">OPTIMISM AND PESSIMISM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I am often called an optimist, and so I am;
but perhaps not in the popular meaning of the
word. When a worldly wise man calls a person
an optimist, he usually regards him with intellectual
contempt, just as the elaborate courtesy
toward women in the age of chivalry thinly disguised
a cynically sensual attitude. Optimism
is associated in many minds either with ignorance
of life or mental inferiority; and when
certain persons call others optimists, look out for
them!</p>

<p>Thus recent definitions of the optimist illustrate
the superior attitude of the pessimist: “An
optimist is a fool unfamiliar with the facts.”
“An optimist is one who falls out of a fourth-story
window, and as he goes by the third story,
he says, ‘So far, so good.’” “An optimist is one
who at night makes lemonade out of the lemons
that have been handed to him all day.” “A
pessimist is one who lives with an optimist.”</p>

<p>Now the familiarly unpleasant back-slapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
cheerio person, with a genius for the inopportune,
is not necessarily an optimist. He is a
nuisance. He was well known and dreaded like
a pestilence among the ancient Jews. See the
Book of Proverbs, 27:14, “He that blesseth his
friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
it shall be counted a curse to him,” and
25:29, “As he that taketh away a garment in
cold weather and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he
that singeth songs to an heavy heart.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A man who attempts to console another by
making light of his troubles or by pretending
that things are otherwise than what they obviously
are will not get very far. One might as
well pretend in January that it is June. You
cannot get rid of obstacles by ignoring them any
more than you can solve problems by forgetting
them. Nor can you console sufferers by reminding
them of the woes of others or by inopportunely
emphasising other things.</p>

<p>If a man slips on an orange peel that some
moron has left on the pavement and breaks his
leg, you will not help him by saying, “Yesterday
a man fell here and broke his <em>neck</em>.” If a manifold
father loses one of his sons by a motor accident,
you can’t help him by saying, “Cheer up!
You’ve got three sons left.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>“Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”
These terrible words were spoken not by a peevish
invalid or by a bankrupt, but by the Light of
the World. He always and everywhere recognised
the forces of evil and never pretended that
life was all sunshine. Religion does not pretend
that everything is easy and comfortable, for religion
is not meant to fill our minds with illusions
but rather with fortitude. Our Lord came
into the world to show us how to bear the burden
of life cheerfully and bravely; life is not easy,
but His yoke is.</p>

<p>A true optimist is one who recognises the sorrows,
worries, drawbacks, misfortunes of life,
its injustice and inequalities. But while seeing
these things, the optimist believes that no matter
how strong error may be, truth in the long
run will triumph, even though it may not be our
truth.</p>

<p>The optimist believes that in the long run
virtue has superior staying power as compared
with vice; that goodness will eventually defeat
evil; that life means something; that character
counts; that men and women are of more consequence
than sparrows; in short, that this is
God’s world and that the moral law is as unshakable
as the law of gravitation.</p>

<p>What, then, is a pessimist? A pessimist is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
one who believes that the evolutionary process
is the tragedy of the universe or, as Mark Twain
put it, that life is the worst practical joke ever
played on man by destiny. That from one primordial
cell should have developed all complex
forms of life through the vegetable kingdom,
through the lower forms of animal existence up
to man, is generally regarded as an advance.
The true pessimist regards it as an irremediable
disaster, as the worst of all possible mistakes.
According to him, it would have been better
had the evolutionary march stopped with the
lower forms of animal life and never reached
self-consciousness.</p>

<p>The fish, for example, is better off than men
and women. The fish functions perfectly. He
does exactly what he was meant to do, he has
not the torture of self-conscious thought, no fear
of death, and dies at the appointed time. But
man has thoughts and dreams and longings that
seem to belong to eternal life and eternal development,
whereas in reality he dies like the fish;
only with all his dreams and longings unsatisfied
and with the constant fear and horror of annihilation
in a universe where, no matter how sublime
or far-reaching his thoughts, he is, in reality,
of no more importance than a fish and must
in the end share the same fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>Taking this stiff definition, are there then any
genuine pessimists? Certainly there are.
Thomas Hardy was exactly such a pessimist.
He affirmed in his last volume of poems that
man would have been happier if he could have
remained at the stage of lower animal development,
with no power of thought. Alfred Housman,
the great lyrical poet, says we could all be
happy, if only we did not think. It is when we
think that we are overwhelmed with gloom.</p>

<p>The custom of congratulating others on their
birthdays is really an acquiescence in optimism.
We instinctively (and I believe rightly) regard
life as an asset. But Swift believed that the
worst thing that had ever happened to him was
being born. He therefore, like the honest man
he was, kept his birthdays as days of fasting and
mourning. He wore black and refused to eat.</p>

<p>For my part I find daily life not always joyous,
but always interesting. I have some sad
days and nights, but none that are dull. As I
advance deeper into the vale of years, I live with
constantly increasing gusto and excitement. I
am sure it all means something; in the last analysis,
I am an optimist because I believe in God.
Those who have no faith are quite naturally
pessimists and I do not blame them.</p>

<span class="subhead">TRANSLATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Of course it is best to read every book in the
language in which it was originally written; but
no man has ever been able to do that. Elihu
Burritt, “the learned blacksmith,” could, so I
have heard, write an intelligible sentence in
fifty languages, but there were many more than
fifty of which he was ignorant. The vast majority
of even intelligent Americans know no
language but their own, and that they do not
know any too well. It becomes necessary,
therefore, unless one is to cut oneself off from
foreign thought and literature, to have recourse
to translations; a reader of a newspaper does
that every day, though he is not always aware
of the fact.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the greatest works of literature
have been translated many times into English,
it is rather important to know which is the best
translation; no one driving a car would take a
bad road if a better one were available.</p>

<p>Great translators are rarer than great creative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
authors. In order to achieve the best possible
translation, one must in the first place have an
absolute command of two languages, an accomplishment
that is not nearly so common as is
often supposed. Indeed, this is too often supposed
erroneously by the translator himself.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the history of the literature of the world,
there are four supremely great poets; no one can
name a fifth who is in their class. Those four,
in chronological order, are Homer, Dante,
Shakespeare and Goethe. Every reader, every
lover of good books, should know something of
the work of these four mighty ones, for there is a
perceptible difference between the best and the
second best. Goethe’s masterpiece is <cite>Faust</cite>, and
it so happens that we have an English translation
of <cite>Faust</cite> that is so much better than all other
English translations that no comparison is possible.
This is by the American, Bayard Taylor.</p>

<p>It was the major work of his life; he spent
many years of sedulous, conscientious toil perfecting
it. It has three admirable features—the
English style is beautiful; it is as literal as is
consistent with elegance, in this work amazingly
literal; it preserves in every instance the original
metres which change so often in the German.
If you wish to know how superior Taylor is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
all other translators of <cite>Faust</cite>, just read aloud
the four stanzas of the Dedication in any other
English version and then try the same experiment
with Taylor’s. Those who cannot read
German and yet wish to come in contact with
“the most spacious mind since Aristotle” have
the satisfaction of knowing they are very close
to the original—both in thought and in expression—in
reading Taylor.</p>

<p>Goethe is not only one of the supreme poets
of the world; he has the distinction of being the
author of the best German novel, <cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite>.
The best translation of this was written
and published by Thomas Carlyle more than
one hundred years ago. In reading this translation,
therefore, one is reading in the same book
the works of two men of genius. Carlyle had
had almost no opportunity to hear spoken German;
he was largely self-taught. But it was
characteristic of his honesty, industry, conscience,
as well as of his literary gifts, that he
should have done his difficult work so well that
no one has been able to equal it.</p>

<p>In the course of the novel occurs the exquisite
lyric <cite>Know’st thou the land?</cite> The best English
translation of this song was made about fifteen
years ago by the late James Elroy Flecker.</p>

<p>No absolutely first-rate translation of Dante<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
into English exists. The best plan is probably
to read one in prose and one in verse; the prose
by Charles Eliot Norton, the verse by Cary.</p>

<p>A large number of English writers have had a
try at Homer. George Chapman, whose version
inspired Keats, made a thundering Elizabethan
poem. Pope, according to his contemporary,
Young, put Achilles into petticoats, but
Pope’s translation has anyhow the merit of being
steadily interesting. Butcher and Lang
wrought together an excellent prose version of
the <cite>Iliad</cite> and <cite>Odyssey</cite>, while the latter poem was
artistically translated into rhythmic prose by
George Herbert Palmer.</p>

<p>There is an English translation of another
work that stands with Taylor’s <cite>Faust</cite> as being
all but impeccable. This is Edward FitzGerald’s
version of the stanzas of Omar Khayyam.
FitzGerald really wrote a great English poem;
it is only necessary to compare his version with
a literal prose translation, in Nathan Haskell
Dole’s admirable Variorum edition, to see how
big is the debt we owe FitzGerald. If Omar
and Edward have met in the other world, I am
sure Old Fitz has received due acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The great Russian novelists, Turgeney, Dostoevski
and Chekhov, have been magnificently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
translated by Constance Garnett. She has also
Englished some of the novels of Tolstoi and
Gogol. She has a positive genius for translation.
In the centenary year—1928—began an
entirely new version of the complete works of
Tolstoi, by Aylmer Maude. Mr. Maude knew
Tolstoi intimately and is himself an admirable
writer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_185">XXXIV<br>

<span class="subhead">MUSIC OF THE SPHERES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When I was a small boy in Hartford, I often
used to see Mark Twain standing in the open
air in his shirt-sleeves, the eternal cigar in his
mouth and a billiard cue in his hand. The billiard
room was on the top floor of his house and
a tiny balcony projected from one of the windows;
nearly all dwellings built in the seventies
had strange abscesses of that kind. While his
opponent was shooting, Mark would come out
on that platform for a breath of air. Billiards
was the only game he cared for; he was by no
means fond of exercise. He always said, “Never
stand up when you can sit down; never sit down
when you can lie down.” Many years later,
when he was living in New York, he often attended
professional billiard matches and the
spectators often looked away from the table at
Mark’s superb leonine head and noble old face.</p>

<p>Another famous contemporary writer also
found his only recreation in billiards—this was
Herbert Spencer. Every afternoon he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
give himself and the unknowable a rest and go
to the Athenæum Club in London for a game,
where his own cue is still preserved as a memorial.
If none of his cronies was available, he
would challenge a stranger. His philosophy
afforded no balm in defeat. On one occasion
when he was beaten badly he put his cue in the
rack and remarked testily that to play billiards
well was an accomplishment; to play it too well
was the sign of a misspent life.</p>

<p>It is rather strange, since most of our American
games are derived from the English, that we
should have taken billiards from France. Few
games are more uncommon in the United States
than English billiards; cricket is not nearly so
unusual a spectacle.</p>

<p>Almost every American boy wants to play
billiards. When I was fourteen one of my
schoolmates found a man who wished to sell a
small table—it had rubber tubes for cushions—but
the price was prohibitive, twenty dollars.
Our total assets were seventy-five cents. We
remembered that my friend’s sister had received
a twenty dollar gold piece as a birthday present.
Of what possible use could it be to her? We
persuaded her to donate it to the good cause, and
if any one thinks that our powers of persuasion
were extraordinary, he thinks accurately, for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
subsequently persuaded her to become my wife.
We bought the table and set it up in my house
late one Saturday night, too late, alas, to play.
Father would not allow me to touch it on Sunday,
and early Monday morning I had to be off
to school. We got out at four o’clock, made
straight for that table and played till eleven at
night, not stopping to eat.</p>

<p>I know of no game at which professional skill
has developed more rapidly than at billiards.
It seems incredible, but only fifty years ago
there were four balls on the table and the ordinary
friendly game was 34 points! Almost any
professional today could run a thousand points—indeed
he could go on indefinitely.</p>

<p>I regret that the beautiful game of cushion-caroms,
so common in the eighties among the
professionals, has become obsolete. In that
game there could be no nursing, because one had
to make the cue ball hit the cushion either before
making the carom or after hitting the object ball.
The gentlemen of the green cloth who were most
proficient at this game were Vignaux, the
Frenchman, and the Americans, “Jake”
Schaefer, father of the present expert of that
name; Slosson, Sexton and Sutton. In Allyn
Hall at Hartford I saw a great match between
Vignaux and Schaefer. M. Vignaux was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
large man and very dignified; in his evening
clothes he looked like a prime minister. Mr.
Schaefer was so small that Maurice Daly used
to call him the little shaver. They were formally
introduced to the spectators by the referee,
who remarked with immense unction, “Mr.
Schaefer has never in his life played with his
coat on; he asks the kind permission of the audience
to remove it.” This privilege was granted
with fervent applause. When the game began
to go against him, M. Vignaux also removed his
swallowtail.</p>

<p>At that time the highest run that had ever
been made at cushion-caroms was 77, which had
been accomplished by Sexton. On this night,
by dazzling open-table play, Schaefer made a
run of 70. He was called the Wizard, because
he played with extreme rapidity, exactly the opposite
of Slosson, who was known as the Student.</p>

<p>Now the popular professional game is the
balkline, 18.2. A recent champion is Edouard
Horemans of Belgium, who won the title from
young Schaefer in a hair-raising match at San
Francisco. Horemans is a left-handed player
and in every respect a worthy champion. His
rail play is phenomenal. I saw him give an exhibition
on his first visit to America in 1920 and
it was clear that he was a dangerous competitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>Who is the greatest player in history? It is
hard to say, but I suspect there never was a
greater player than Napoleon Ives. He was
one of the first to use a cue weighing more than
twenty ounces and was all but unbeatable.
Schaefer (senior) once beat him with the anchor
shot, which was afterward barred. Unfortunately,
tuberculosis cut Ives off in his prime.
The heated room, the chalk dust and the excitement
of close contests were too much for
him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_190">XXXV<br>

<span class="subhead">DOG BOOKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The dog, except in very high latitudes, is not
so useful as the horse, the mule, the camel, the
donkey; he cannot supply food and drink, like
the cow and the goat; but for all that, he is,
among all the lower animals, man’s best friend.
Even here, as in bipeds, we do not prize our
friends for what they can do for us, but for their
mental and moral qualities.</p>

<p>If it were possible to collect in one heap all the
books and articles that men have written in
praise of dogs, it would be a sky-scraper. I cannot
tell what the earliest literary allusion to dogs
is; but I think it strange that the Bible is so
silent. Those books representing the social history
of the Jews for many centuries, contain the
most beautiful poetry and prose ever written, as
well as the most tender and comforting assurances;
but they indicate little interest in animals
as companions or pets. The word dog is
repeatedly used as a term of degradation, and
for some unknown reason the Jews were forbidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
to bring into the sanctuary the price of a
dog, which was coupled with the wages of sin.
The only allusion I have found to the dog as a
companion is in the Apocrypha, in the eleventh
chapter of Tobit: “So they went their way, and
the dog went after them.” Even here the dog
apparently had to force his attentions upon man,
which is a way he has when unappreciated.</p>

<p>The fact that in the New Testament the dogs
ate of the crumbs from the table and that the
street dogs licked the sores of Lazarus the beggar,
proves nothing in the way of appreciation;
other animals moved freely about the houses in
Palestine, and they were not kept for the charm
of their company.</p>

<p>But in the old Indian books of the East, many
centuries before Christ, the dog’s fidelity and
social attractions were prized; as is shown by
the well-known story of the righteous pilgrim
coming to the gates of heaven with his dog. He
was told to walk right in. “And my dog?”
“Oh, no dogs allowed.” “All right, then I don’t
go in.” This man thought heaven would not be
heaven without dogs, as Siegmund cared naught
for heaven without Sieglinde.</p>

<p>Pope alluded to the Indian love of dogs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His faithful dog shall bear him company.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>
<p>The Greeks loved dogs. One of the most affecting
incidents in Homer’s <cite>Odyssey</cite> is where
Ulysses returns after years of wandering, and,
being in rags, no one recognises him. But his
dog Argos, who had waited for his master expectantly
all these years, instantly sees and
knows him, and through the beggar’s disguise
salutes the king. He wags his tail and dies of
joy.</p>

<p>English literature is filled with dogolatry.
Dr. John Brown’s <cite>Rab and His Friends</cite> (1858),
became a little classic. Tennyson worshipped
dogs, and always had two or three huge dogs in
the room while he composed poetry, which he
read aloud to them. His poem <cite>Owd Roa</cite> (Old
Rover), describes how a dog saved a family when
the house was on fire. Bret Harte made a marvellous
sketch of the strange appearance and
characteristics of the dog Boonder. Stevenson
wrote a whimsical essay, <cite>The Character of Dogs</cite>,
in which he proves conclusively that many dogs
are snobs. They certainly are; they will fawn
on well-dressed strangers, and try to bite the
iceman.</p>

<p>Maeterlinck has declared that the dog is the
only conscious being in the world who knows
and is sure of his god; in <cite>The Blue Bird</cite> he exalted
the moral character of the dog, though I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
find it hard to forgive him for his slander of the
cat. Richard Harding Davis’s masterpiece—among
all his brilliant short stories—is <cite>The Bar
Sinister</cite>, an imaginative study of dogs. Rudyard
Kipling has celebrated the virtues of dogs
both in prose and verse.</p>

<p>Vivisection and dogs have called out many
poems, of which two of the most notable are
Robert Browning’s <cite>Tray</cite> and Percy MacKaye’s
<cite>The Heart of a Dog</cite>.</p>

<p>Jack London’s masterpiece is <cite>The Call of the
Wild</cite>, where the great dog reverted to primitive
impulses and habits. This is an imperishable
work of literature, and although cast in the
form of prose fiction, has much of the elevation
and majesty of poetry. Among contemporary
writers, Albert Payson Terhune has specialised
in dogs, and done admirable work in canine psychoanalysis.
The late Senator Vest, when a
young man, made a speech in court on dogs
which will outlast his political orations.</p>

<p>But of all the works in prose or verse, ancient
or modern that celebrates the virtues of the dog,
the most admirable is the novel, <cite>Bob, Son of
Battle</cite>, by the late Alfred Ollivant. It was published
in 1898, and was his first book, written
under peculiar circumstances. Mr. Ollivant
was a young Englishman who had injured his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
spine in football; then, having apparently recovered,
he received a commission in the artillery
at the age of nineteen. A fall from his
horse permanently injured him, so that he was
an invalid for the rest of his life—he died in
1927. For the first few years he was not able to
leave his bed, and at the age of twenty, in horizontal
pain and weakness, began to write <cite>Bob</cite>.
It took him three years to finish the book. In
England it was published under the poor title,
<cite>Owd Bob</cite>, and attracted no attention; but in
America the publishers wisely changed the name
to the alliterative <cite>Bob, Son of Battle</cite>, and the
book sold by the hundred thousand. (Those
who are interested in the first editions should
know that the first English edition differs in
style from the first American edition; the London
publishers delayed publication, and the
author revised the story without injuring it.)</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that this book, written by
an Englishman for Englishmen, and dealing exclusively
with English scenes and customs,
should have attracted no attention in the land
of its birth, while selling like the proverbial hot
cakes in every city and village in America. In
public lectures in Texas, California, and all over
the middle West and the East, I had only to
mention the name of this novel and a wave of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
delighted recognition swept over the audience.
But even ten years after its appearance it was
practically unheard of in England. I asked William
De Morgan, Henry Arthur Jones, and
William Archer if they had read it; they had
never heard of it.</p>

<p>Some years after that, however, a cheap edition
was published in Great Britain, and the
book slowly made its way, and is now over there
as here an acknowledged classic. Its popularity
was increased by its being made into a motion
picture, and Mr. Ollivant was elected to the
Athenæum.</p>

<p>The two most remarkable dogs I ever met in
fiction are both in <cite>Bob, Son of Battle</cite>—the hero,
Bob, the Grey Dog of Kenmuir, and the villain
Red Wull. Their continued rivalry has an epic
force and fervour. It is the eternal strife between
the Power of Light and the Power of
Darkness.</p>

<span class="subhead">GOING TO HONOLULU</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Remember to pronounce the first syllable to
rhyme with “bone,” not with “on.” But, above
all, remember, when you are there, never to
speak of coming from the United States or from
America—you are in the United States. Call
your home “the mainland.” I was once giving
a lecture in California and I thoughtlessly began
a sentence this way: “When I get back to America”—I
never finished that sentence. It was
owing only to the sense of humour possessed by
the audience that I was able to finish the lecture.</p>

<p>People who have travelled all over the world
say there are only two places that may accurately
be called paradise; they are the Hawaiian
Islands and Ceylon. If the wind is right, you
get the spicy perfume from Ceylon before the
island is visible, as it is written in the missionary
hymn. I have never seen Ceylon, but
Hawaii will do very well as an earthly paradise.
The most vivid and alluring description of it
came from the pen of Mark Twain and is to be
found at the end of that work of genius, <cite>Roughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
It</cite>. In a certain sense, Mark was always
homesick for these islands. He saw them in his
youth and he remembered them in his old age.</p>

<p>In honor of Lord Sandwich, Captain Cook in
1778 named them the Sandwich Islands. The
next year he was killed there and a native chief
affirmed that he had eaten the Captain’s heart.
I hope it gave him indigestion.</p>

<p>The islands were conquered by the native
king, Kamehameha I, who died in 1819. He
was a great man, a combination of warrior and
statesman, like William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>In 1820 the American missionaries arrived.
They found the natives amiable, like many of
the children of the sun, but without religion,
morality or education. Just the most blessed
state imaginable, say many of our modern
writers, whose highest ideal for humanity is animalism.
The advantage of such an ideal is that
one does not have to struggle to reach it—hence
its popularity.</p>

<p>These missionaries were heroic. They came
around Cape Horn in sailing vessels and they
had to send their children back to the mainland
for education by the same route. All ministers
of the gospel believe in education and make sacrifices
for it.</p>

<p>King Kalakaua was a picturesque and easy-tempered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
monarch, who loved liquor. His trip
around the world was an illuminating excursion
in every sense of the word. When he was at the
British court, a terrific question of etiquette
arose which puzzled the wise men. Should he,
in going into dinner after Queen Victoria, precede
or follow Edward, Prince of Wales? The
matter was settled by the tact and wit of the
Prince. “The man is either a king and should
precede me, or he should go into the dining-room
with a napkin over his arm.”</p>

<p>In 1893 Queen Liliuokalani tried to get a new
Constitution giving more power to the throne.
An American revolution—the third in our history—took
place, and a republic was established,
with the late Sanford B. Dole as President. In
1898 the republic was annexed to the United
States and in 1900 became the Territory of
Hawaii. It will some day become a State.</p>

<p>The voyage thither from San Francisco usually
takes six days. Leaving the Golden Gate
in a cold fog, one sees hump-backed whales, and
thirty miles out the only land, the Farallone
Islands, a desolate, melancholy place for school
teachers. But school teachers are used to getting
the worst of it. The weather is cold for
two days, then mild, then warm; plenty of flying
fish by day, strange phosphorescence in the sea<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
by night, and overhead unfamiliar stars. The
Southern Cross appears, a subject for dispute.</p>

<p>The climate is celestial—much too good for
this world. Never hot, never cold in Honolulu.
The year round it usually has a minimum of 70,
a maximum of 83. The constant northeast
trade winds make the climate suitable for civilised
man, but they also bring frequent showers.
The inhabitants will not admit that these
showers are rain—they call them liquid sunshine.
They are indeed liquid. On one elevation
the wind blows so hard that it is difficult to
stand upright and on top of one mountain I saw
a waterfall up instead of down, the wind catching
it just as it left the rock. But on the small
island Oahu, containing Honolulu, one can find
an immense variety of wind and weather.
Those who dislike showers can live where it
practically never rains; other places have genial,
windless heat, and still others have the cooling,
beneficent breeze.</p>

<p>It is an international place and the brethren
dwell together in unity. The streets are filled
with Americans, Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese,
Portuguese, English, Germans and other folks,
who seem to get along together very well indeed.
Punahou College was founded in 1841 and is the
oldest American college or university west of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
the Mississippi. There I saw a remarkable historical
pageant, attended by ex-President Dole
and ex-Queen Lil. One of the natives made a
long address to the Queen, which I wish I could
have understood. Her face was grave and impassive
and when I was presented to her, I was
deeply impressed by her anachronistic expression.
She seemed to be living in the past.</p>

<p>I visited many of the schools. At Kaiulaui
School there were among the pupils fifty-eight
varieties of nationalities—I remember the exact
number, as it was one more than the mystic
fifty-seven. The United States flag was brought
out; the children sang The Star-Spangled Banner.
Then they recited part of Longfellow’s
<cite>Building of the Ship</cite>. In the primary grade of
another school, the teacher was a Japanese lady.
The children seem entirely free from the bigotry
of nationalism. The word “foreigner” is not an
epithet and the children exhibit that rarest of
all human things—democracy.</p>

<p>The natural wonders on the biggest island of
the group, Hawaii, beggar description. You
must go there yourselves. But I have always
been more interested in human nature than in
nature. I have seldom seen the latter and
never the former show to better advantage than
in these delectable oases of the ocean.</p>

<span class="subhead">HYMNS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The church to which I belong has this very
day furnished itself with a new set of hymn-books;
when I enter my accustomed pew tomorrow
morning I shall find there attractive
new volumes. Which fact leads me to the consideration
of hymns in general.</p>

<p>The worst verses in the world are to be found
among epitaphs and encomiums of the dead. I
remember a certain town in Connecticut where
the local poet hovered over the bedside of the
dying, like a vulture watching a sick horse. Before
the corpse was cold, this poetical ghoul had
his poem on the “remains” in the village paper.
You had to get up very early in the morning to
die before he beat you to it, as Matthew Arnold
would not say. He added new terrors to death.</p>

<p>Well, probably, in the number of bad verses,
hymns rank a good second to epitaphs. There
are so many bad hymns that some scoffers think
there are few good ones. Such a generalisation
is wide of the truth. The literature of hymnology<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
contains many masterpieces; innumerable
hymns of the church are as beautiful in poetic
art as they are devout in aspiration. If we took
all the hymns out of English literature, the loss
would be huge.</p>

<p>If a secret ballot could be taken among all
classes of people to discover the choice of the
favourite hymn, I think it would appear that
Cardinal Newman’s <cite>Lead, Kindly Light</cite> had a
majority of votes.</p>

<p>I happened to be in London at the time of
Newman’s death in 1890, himself just as old as
the nineteenth century. Then were the old bitter
controversies forgotten; Catholics, Protestants
and the unclassed united in tributes to the
genius and beauty of the great Cardinal’s mind
and character. And as creeds were for the moment
forgotten, so there came instinctively to
every one’s lips the words of Newman’s creedless
hymn, as creedless as the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p>The vicissitudes of literary fame are beyond
divination. Who, including first of all Newman,
could have dreamed that when the young
man composed that poem, it would outlast his
scholarly, controversial, pietistic and literary
prose of eighty years? Yet such is the fact.</p>

<p>On June 16, 1833, while in a calm at sea, on
board an orange-boat and thinking of his doctrinal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
perplexities, these lines came into Newman’s
mind; as suddenly, as inexplicably, as
fortunately as the stanzas <cite>Crossing the Bar</cite> came
to Tennyson on a ferryboat crossing the Solent.
Newman called the poem, <cite>The Pillar and the
Cloud</cite>.</p>

<p>For details concerning its composition and for
some interesting criticisms on the poem itself I
will refer readers to Dr. Joseph J. Reilly’s admirable
book, <cite>Newman as a Man of Letters</cite>.</p>

<p>Two of our best American hymn writers are
two of our national poets—Whittier and Holmes.
The hymns of Whittier are beautiful in their
simplicity, sincerity, and universal application:</p>

<p>Two hymns by Addison, written more than
two hundred years ago, are familiar to all churchgoers—one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
<cite>The spacious firmament on high</cite>,
which was a favourite with Thackeray, and the
other, beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When all Thy mercies, O my God.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">I have always especially liked one stanza of this
hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ten thousand thousand precious gifts</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">My daily thanks employ;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor is the least a cheerful heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That tastes those gifts with joy.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">After enumerating many blessings for which he
is grateful to God, Addison quite rightly includes
the gift of a cheerful heart. Those who are ever
fastidious, difficult to please and not grateful
for anything miss much happiness.</p>

<p>The king of hymn-writers is Isaac Watts
(1674–1748). Although churchgoers sing his
hymns every Sunday, he has never received due
literary credit for his magnificent sacred poems.
<cite>When I Survey the Wondrous Cross</cite> is a hymn
of tremendous passion. In one of his novels
Arnold Bennett calls it “that amazing hymn.”
In other hymns by Watts there is an austere
grandeur.</p>

<p>Frederick William Faber (1814–1863) is another
master of the art of hymn writing. <cite>Hark,
Hark, My Soul!</cite> and <cite>There’s a Wideness in God’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Mercy</cite> are known everywhere. No martial song
was ever more inspiring than <cite>Faith of Our
Fathers</cite>, with its thrilling second stanza. I often
wonder when people sing that stanza in
church, sing it mechanically with their thoughts
elsewhere, what would happen if they took it
literally:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Were still in heart and conscience free;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And blest would be their children’s fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If they, like them, should die for Thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faith of our fathers, holy faith,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We will be true to Thee till death.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One of the greatest of all hymns, <cite>Nearer, My
God, to Thee</cite>, was written by Sarah Flower, a
friend of the young poet Robert Browning.
The first time it was ever heard in public was
when Sarah and Eliza Flower sang it as a duet
in the Rev. Mr. Fox’s church. Little did those
sisters guess that they had added to the Christian
church all over the world an imperishable
song.</p>

<p>Scores of other hymns might be mentioned,
hymns that are exalted and passionate in feeling
and aspiration and nobly poetic in expression.</p>

<p>It is a pity that we so seldom hear good congregational
singing. People nowadays let
others do their singing for them, as well as their
praying. If one will look at the faces of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
audience in church and notice that although
their mouths are open no sound emerges, one
will be reminded of a cat on the back doorstep
on a winter morning. You look at the cat and
the animal opens its mouth as if to mew, but
has not sufficient energy to bring the articulate
mew to the surface—just an expression of vague
discomfort. So during the singing of hymns I
see people with no animation in their faces and
with open, silent mouths, like the dry mew of
the cat.</p>

<span class="subhead">OLD-FASHIONED SNOBS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I suppose there never was a time in the history
of human society without snobs—that is,
without young men of fashion who wished to be
thought prominent members of the smart set.
The slang of various epochs has called them
macaronies, dandies, dudes, toffs, swells—but
under various appellations the creature is the
same, with the same habits. There are certain
persons who cultivate superficial elegancies and
are never caught in an informal attitude or off
their guard. Lowell said that if N.&nbsp;P. Willis
had lived in the Garden of Eden he would have
attracted attention by the way he wore his skin.</p>

<p>About three centuries ago, in the spacious
times of Queen Elizabeth, as we learn from the
plays of Shakespeare and of his contemporaries,
and from a satirical guide-book written by
Thomas Dekker, the typical young snob in London
got through an average day in the following
manner:</p>

<p>He rose at noon. Late rising has always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
an essential feature of snobbery; because if one
gets up early, it proves that one has to earn one’s
living, and to support oneself is incompatible
with swelldom. If any one thinks that the idea
of Walter Camp’s setting-up exercise is new, let
me remind him that the Elizabethan dandy, invariably
after rising, took a whole series of gymnastic
exercises while stark naked. The object
of this was twofold: he had to keep in fair physical
condition, and these exercises helped to take
out of his system the invariable “hangover.”</p>

<p>He then dressed with the utmost care, and here
we must remember an essential difference between
the mental attitude of Elizabethans and
that of young men of today. The late Professor
Moulton said that the chief characteristic of our
age was anticonspicuousness. And this is quite
true. Women wear short skirts not to attract
attention, but to avoid it. We follow fashions
to escape notoriety. But in Elizabethan times
exactly the contrary was true.</p>

<p>The most democratic garment in the world today
is men’s evening dress. After six o’clock,
in any locality in the so-called civilised world, a
man is in style with the black dinner jacket or
swallow-tail. Time and again the tailors have
fought this, doing their best to persuade men to
wear something in colour, or at all events something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
more individual. But the men thus far
have succeeded in preserving economical uniformity.</p>

<p>Now in Elizabethan times the garments of
men were as gorgeous as the feathers of male
birds. A group of men talking together was a
“riot of colour.” A man wore soft leather boots,
narrow at the ankle, and with immense, colored
flaring tops. His knee breeches were tight-fitting
silk or satin. His jacket was a slashed
doublet, brilliant in colour; at the neck was an
enormous white ruff, which must have kept the
laundries busy; imagine eating soup over that
ruff! Over the doublet he wore a short velvet
cloak, with a high collar. The hat was as elaborate
in design as the old style woman’s Easter
bonnet, very broad, with an audacious feather.
And, of course, he invariably carried a sword,
with jewelled hilt.</p>

<p>In this array our young swell walked at ease
in the centre aisle of St. Paul’s Cathedral, the
favourite place for fashionable display. His
tailor sometimes accompanied him like a detective
and, in response to a signal, took notes of
some new and particularly splendid costume.
The young man would salute noblemen and
aristocrats in a loud voice, calling them, if he
dared, by their first name, so as to give the impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
of intimacy; for it was essential then,
as now, to be with the “right crowd.” In stentorian
tones he would make an appointment for
a two o’clock luncheon at an expensive eating
house. After luncheon, the toothpick was
prominently displayed while on promenade.</p>

<p>In contrast to the modern soldier, who never
speaks of his war experiences, the young Elizabethan,
if he had fought in the Low Countries or
elsewhere, bragged noisily about it in all public
places. If he were a poet, he behaved like a
tenth-rate poet in Paris today. He entered a
restaurant with a solemn, preoccupied air, and,
in taking his glove from his pocket, purposely
let fall a manuscript. Some one would pick it
up and he would remark that it was only a poem
he had dashed off an hour ago; but he would
manage the conversation so that he would be
asked to read it aloud.</p>

<p>Tobacco was “coming in” then, and every
young swell must be able to smoke in public
without becoming sick. They had their favourite
pipes and elaborate silver pouches; they
talked about the different brands of tobacco like
a professional, and it was a great accomplishment
to blow rings.</p>

<p>All public theatrical performances were in the
afternoon. The swell always entered late, attracting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
as much attention as possible, and took
a seat on the stage, in full view of the audience.
In the midst of a tragedy, he laughed aloud, to
show his immunity to sentiment; at a funny
play he scowled and sometimes noisily left the
theatre, clanking his spurs, and saluting acquaintances
as he passed out. Sometimes he
would take a rush from the stage floor and playfully
tickle the ear of one of the actors.</p>

<p>After the play, he went to the tavern, where
it was important to call the waiters by their
first names, showing that he was a regular patron;
and when the bill was presented he must
never look at the items or add them up, which
might show that he was a family man, or familiar
with current prices; no, he must glance
carelessly at the total, and pay with a big tip.</p>

<p>Then in the night he went to his lodgings.
One must remember there were no paved streets
in London and no sidewalks and no lights; if the
young gentleman could afford it, he had a linkboy,
carrying a torch, precede him, for in Dryden’s
later phrase, the real swell “sailed behind
his link.” The boy was properly tipped, so that
if he met strangers, he would call out, “My lord,
step this way.” Then others gave him place,
and the officers of the law respected his intoxicated
condition. And so to bed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_212">XXXIX<br>

<span class="subhead">A FAIR CITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Almost every writer and thinker has the city
of his dreams, his Utopia. In recent years the
novelists W.&nbsp;H. Hudson, H.&nbsp;G. Wells and Alfred
Ollivant have each published a book setting
forth a conception of the ideal community. It
is not my purpose to add another Utopia but
rather to call attention to an actual city, which,
while it is imperfect like everything else in this
motley world, has nevertheless many advantages
that might well be imitated by American
cities. I refer to Munich, Germany.</p>

<p>Munich is my favourite European town. I
had rather live in the United States of America
than in any other country; partly because I was
born here, partly because I like the country anyway,
but if I could not live in the United States
I had rather live in Munich than in any other
city in the world.</p>

<p>Munich is nearly as large as Boston and yet as
quiet as a country village. Where the people
are I don’t know, but those who are familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
with Boylston and Tremont Streets in Boston
will see nothing like that in Munich. The
streets are calm, the sidewalks uncrowded, the
highway uncongested by traffic; there is no
Great White Way; there are no flaring lights;
there is no hurly-burly. You can hear your own
footsteps. An American who arrived at Munich
at nine o’clock in the evening, observing the silence
of the streets, asked his taxi driver to take
him somewhere. The driver said, “Isn’t that
rather indefinite?” “You know what I mean—take
me where there is a lot of noise and a lot of
people.” The driver answered, “What you want
is the railway station.” And indeed that is the
only place in Munich that fulfills those requirements.</p>

<p>There is everything in Munich to make a cultivated
foreigner happy, cheerful and content
with a long stay. I have never seen any town
that has so much to give to the visitor. In the
first place, everything that one wants to see is
within easy walking distance. If one rooms in
a boarding house on a side street off the Ludwig
Strasse, one can walk in a few moments to the
university, to the public library, to the concert
halls, to the State Opera House, to the State
Theatre, to the Play House, to the art galleries;
and the English Garden, an enormous tract of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
land, is in the centre of the town and close to all
of these other delectable places. In the English
Garden in summer one may take long walks or
one may sit down and hear music as one sips
coffee or beer. In the winter one may skate on
the frozen lake. Those who are fond of winter
sports have the mountains close at hand. It is
estimated that on some Sunday mornings in
winter 100,000 people take an early train to the
mountains for skiing and other amusements. In
the summer the environs of Munich are beautiful.
There is a series of lakes where one may
take excursions in a little steamer or in a rowboat;
where one may visit famous old castles
and see the treasures with which they are filled.</p>

<p>If one is fond of tennis, there are three or four
tennis courts in the heart of the city where one
may become a visiting member at a nominal fee
and find plenty of agreeable companions. The
golf links are ten minutes by trolley, and there
again the entrance fee is nominal. The only
objection that I have to the golf links is that the
magnificent mountains are so near that one is
constantly tempted to lift up one’s eyes to the
hills, and, however valuable it may be for one’s
spiritual development, it is fatal to one’s efficiency
in golf.</p>

<p>Every night in Munich there is something interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
to hear at the opera, at the theatre or
at the concert hall. Every morning there is
published a little paper devoted exclusively to
theatrical and musical affairs. This paper gives
every event that will take place in the city in the
afternoon and evening, with the exact time of
beginning, the exact time of closing and a complete
list of the actors, singers and performers.</p>

<p>One of the chief attractions of the theatre and
the operas in Munich is the fact that they begin
early. The opera begins at six o’clock and is
always over before ten, except in the case of a
very long opera. The plays begin at seven-thirty
and in nearly every instance are over at
nine-thirty. In other words, the opera and
theatres are run not for the benefit of members
of a leisure class who do not have to get up the
next morning but for the ordinary citizen and
his family who are obliged to rise early and go to
work. In New York, in Paris and in London
theatre-going and opera-going are in the nature
of a dissipation. The theatres in Paris do not
close until midnight, and in New York and London
one does not usually get to one’s domicile
before that. The result is that one is exhausted,
and, according to Kipling, “There is
nothing certain but the morning head.” To go
to the theatre or opera four nights in succession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
in London, Paris or New York—unless one is
able to rise very late the next day—is an exhausting
ordeal, but in Munich, during a period
of seven months, I averaged five nights a week
at the opera and theatre and never felt fatigue.</p>

<p>There is another advantage about beginning
early. Instead of going to the opera or theatre
stuffed with a soggy dinner and made somnolent
by food, one takes tea before going and when the
entertainment is over one goes into a cheerful
café and has a hot supper in delightful company
and is in bed before eleven.</p>

<p>What does going to the theatre mean in New
York, London and Paris? It too often means
something like this. One attends a dinner party
where half the guests arrive late; one then has a
long course dinner, hurried toward the end; the
entire company is hustled into automobiles and
arrives at the theatre or opera a half hour after
the performance has begun and in a condition
that precludes the possibility of mental concentration.</p>

<p>After one has spent two or three months in
Munich, one falls in love with the place, with
the temper of the town and with the people. I
am frequently homesick for Munich. In one
year, after I had spent four months there, I went
in April to Italy—the land where the lemon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
trees bloom. There I lived in sunshine and enjoyed
the glory and beauty of the romantic country.
But after a while I became homesick for
Munich and, although on the morning of my
return it was raining and the weather in general
was doing its worst, my heart was singing, for I
was home again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_218">XL<br>

<span class="subhead">TRADITIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Whether we like it or not, we are governed by
the past. The books written by men long dead
have the largest influence in shaping our minds
and ruling our conduct; the laws that control
our duties and our privileges as citizens were
made by men whose names we cannot remember;
spirit hands guide our footsteps; we think
the thoughts of our ancestors and carry into
execution conceptions formed by them. The
muscles of our bodies and the swifter impulses
of our minds are set in motion by thousands of
men and women. We have been shaped by our
traditions. We can ourselves add something to
these traditions, but even if we would, we cannot
annihilate them. They are as real as we are.</p>

<p>Many Americans have such a militant consciousness
of independence that they cannot endure
the thought of having America’s destiny in
any way influenced by hands across the sea.
“What! do you mean to say that foreigners shall
tell us what we may and may not do?” Now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
truth is, that not only men in foreign nations
have a vital influence on our present conduct
and future acts, but that this is especially true
of those foreigners who have been dead for centuries.
The situation is humiliating. Bad
enough to have an absentee ruler alive—how
much more insupportable when he has ceased to
exist!</p>

<p>Nothing is more foolish than to despise the
past or to attempt to arrange the future without
a sound knowledge of history. The difficulty
with some radical reformers is that they
are deficient in historical knowledge. They do
not know that the experiment they have in mind
has been tried so many times without success
that some lesson might possibly be gained by
observation of previous results. “Histories
make men wise,” said Bacon; they make us wise,
not merely because history books were written
by wise men, but because history itself is the
accumulation of human wisdom gleaned from
human folly. To sneer at the past is to sneer at
wisdom. For despite the glib way in which the
word evolution is used, despite the advances
made in personal luxuries, housing and locomotion,
despite the broad (rather than deep) diffusion
of culture by which reading and writing
have become no more conspicuous than breathing—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
is not one scintilla of evidence to
prove that the individual mind has advanced a
single step in the power of thought, or in the
ability to reason, or in the possession of wisdom.
The men of ancient times—as represented by
their leaders—were in every respect as able-minded
as the best products of the twentieth
century.</p>

<p>Reflexion makes us realise the imponderable
worth of traditions; we know they come only
from years. Even if every man had his price,
which is not true, there are things beyond all
price. A boy who goes to Cambridge or Oxford
has something in his education beyond the price
he pays for his tuition, or the instruction he receives
in lectures, or the advantages of modern
laboratories. The grey walls of the cloisters,
the noble old towers, the enchanting beauty of
the quadrangle, represent not only the best in
architecture, but they are hallowed by thousands
of ghosts. Lowell coined the phrase, “God’s
passionless reformers, influences.” These influences,
silently but chronically active, like a deep-flowing
river, give something that no recently
founded institution can bring; something that
makes the so-called almighty dollar look impotent.
Any well-disposed multi-millionaire can
start a well-equipped university; in time it, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
will have its traditions; but many centuries give
a tone and a stamp that cannot be bought or
sold.</p>

<p>A certain independent humour accompanies
those who live in ancient surroundings—and
this humour is frequently the Anglo-Saxon way
of expressing pride. After dining in hall with
the dons one evening in a college at Oxford, we
adjourned successively to three rooms. I asked
one of my hosts if that had always been the custom.
“No, indeed,” said he, with a smile; “in
fact, it is comparatively recent. We have been
doing this only since the seventeenth century.”
He spoke as though it were a rather startling innovation.
A wealthy American was so pleased
with the velvet turf of the Oxford quadrangles
that he asked a janitor how such turf was produced;
it appeared that he wished his front
lawn at home to wear a similar aspect. The
janitor replied that the matter was simple; all
that was necessary was to wait a thousand years.
Age sometimes really comes before beauty.</p>

<p>When the Englishman Thomas Hardy sat
down in his house at Dorchester to write a poem,
he knew that the ground in his garden was
filled with the relics of Roman occupation—pottery,
utensils and human bones. Twenty
centuries were in his dooryard. No wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
there is dignity in his compositions when their
roots go so deep.</p>

<p>Tennyson said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That man’s the best cosmopolite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who loves his native country best.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">I suppose he meant that the man who loved his
own country was better fitted to love all countries
and thus become a citizen of the world than
one who, while professing to be swayed only by
international sentiment, should have little affection
for any country in particular. We are
familiar with the type of man who is filled with
enthusiasm for humanity, but who never helps
an individual; love, like charity, should begin
at home. It is a singular but happy human
characteristic that we love so ardently the scenes
of our childhood; even those brought up in a
detestable climate will, when far away in golden
sunlight, become homesick for the fog, the mist,
and the rain. Many who have left home in
early manhood will return thither in old age, as
though drawn by invisible but irresistible bonds.</p>

<p>American traditions go back to Colonial days;
and those days went back to the English country
and English speech. We ought not to forget
these traditions or be untrue to the best that
is in Anglo-Saxon civilisation. Perhaps no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
thing is more necessary to the welfare and peace
of the world today than frank, hearty, sincere
friendship and good will between Great Britain
and the United States.</p>

<p>There are intelligent and well-educated persons
who believe in ghosts—I mean they believe
in the actual reappearance on earth in visible
form of certain individuals who have for some
time been dead and buried. These are the genuine
ghosts, not the creations of fear or fancy, but
as the French call them, <i lang="fr">revenants</i>, those who
come back. Hamlet’s father was a true ghost,
seen by a number of reliable witnesses; the
bloody Banquo at the dinner table was the
painting of Macbeth’s fear, actually not there
at all.</p>

<p>The late William De Morgan was a devout
believer in ghosts, was convinced that he had
himself seen a sufficient number for purposes
of verification, and hence did not scruple to introduce
them into his novels.</p>

<p>I have not been so fortunate. I cannot even
say as many do, “I do not believe in ghosts, but
I am afraid of them.” I will not say that I do
not believe in them, but I am not afraid of them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
I never saw one. I have never seen or heard
anything that could not be explained in some
commonplace fashion. There are many who affirm
that they have seen in broad daylight the
face and figure of a friend, and as they have
drawn nearer in order to converse, the appearance
became a disappearance, without any rational
explanation. The friend may be living,
or he may have long since died. A great many
persons are “seeing things,” and I rather envy
them. Others have distinctly felt a touch on
the shoulder, and on turning, no one was discoverable.
I have always, alas, found the responsible
party.</p>

<p>But though I have never seen spooks, I have
had a few spooky experiences, of which I will
mention two.</p>

<p>One night, with the exception of the maids on
the top floor, I was alone in the house. I had
not been well for many days, and felt particularly
miserable when I went to bed. I had lain
uneasily for some hours, and had finally lapsed
into semi-consciousness. At half-past two I
was startled by the loud ringing of the front
door bell. Accoutred as I was, I descended, and
opened the door. There was no one. For a
few moments, like the man in Poe’s poem, I
stood, deep into the darkness peering. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
darkness gave no token, and wonderingly I shut
the door. I had not got half-way up the stairs,
when once again the doorbell rang with violence.
It is easy enough to tell this lightly now,
but then, alone in the house, and ill, it was
worse than mysterious. I ran to the door, and
flung it wide open. Not a soul in sight, the
street silent and deserted. Then I thought it
might after all not have been the doorbell, but
the telephone. Accordingly I rang up Central,
only to be informed that no one had called my
number. While I was considering this, the doorbell
once more reverberated through the empty
house. Again I opened the door. No one.</p>

<p>I decided that some one with a deficient or
perverted sense of humour was making me a
victim. Accordingly I shut the front door, and
crouched directly behind it, with the intention
of leaping out and seizing the humorist as soon
as he rang again. In a few moments the bell
rang loudly; I jerked back the door and sprang
outside. But there was absolutely no one, and
there was no sound of retreating steps.</p>

<p>I stood outside the door, lost in amazement
and fear, for I was terrified. I gazed wonderingly
at the button, half-expecting to see some
spirit-finger push it; when, to my utter dismay,
the bell rang shriller and louder than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span></p>

<p>If I had really believed in ghosts, that would
have been sufficient evidence. As it is, I shall
never forget my distress while the bell continued
ringing and I was looking directly at the
only means of making it ring. I closed the door,
and had a bad night.</p>

<p>In the morning I consulted a specialist, not
on nerves, but on doorbells. The explanation
was simple. A mouse was enjoying the flavour
of the paraffin in which the wires in the cellar
were wrapped, and every time he gave a particularly
fervent bite, the bell rang. I hope it
scared him as much as it did me, but if so, his
hunger triumphed over his fear, for he kept returning
to the feast.</p>

<p>On another occasion I was out shooting in a
desolate place in Michigan. I was accompanied
by my friend, A.&nbsp;K. Merritt, now Registrar
of Yale College, who will vouch for the truth of
the story. Dusk was falling; there was no wind.
We had wandered into a scene of stagnant desolation.
Dead trees had fallen in rotten ruin
across the trail, and the swampy pools were covered
with a green mantle of decay. Merritt
was walking in front and I close behind him.
The gloom and depression of the scene in the
deepening dusk had affected our spirits, so that
we had not spoken for some time. Suddenly I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
thought of the scenery of Browning’s poem,
<cite>Childe Roland</cite>. The lines of that masterpiece
of horror would well describe this place, I
thought; and I began to repeat them in my mind
without saying a word aloud. Then methought
there was only one thing needed to make the
picture complete. That was the horrible horse,
which in the poem stood alone and sinister in
the gathering night. If that horse were here, I
said to myself, this would indeed be the veritable
country of Childe Roland. Something impelled
me to look behind my back, and, to my
unutterable surprise and horror, I found myself
looking directly into the eyes of a forlorn old
horse. I let out a yell of sheer uncontrollable
terror.</p>

<p>Merritt was as startled by the yell as I had
been by its cause. I asked him if the horse was
really there. It was bad to have him there,
but worse if he were not. Merritt reassured me
on that point.</p>

<p>I suppose the poor old horse had been pensioned
off by some farmer, and had silently followed
us on the spongy ground, either because
he was lonesome or because he wanted salt.
But he gave me the shock of my life.</p>

<p>I have thought much about it since, and I am
unable to determine whether the appearance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
of the horse at the precise moment when I was
thinking of him was a coincidence—or was I all
the time subconsciously aware of his presence?
That is to say, did the nearness of the horse, even
though I had no conscious knowledge of it, suggest
to my subconscious mind the lines from the
poem? I wish I knew.</p>

<span class="subhead">TRIAL BY JURY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When I was an undergraduate at Yale, we
were fortunate in having as one of our professors
Edward John Phelps, who was unexpectedly
appointed minister to England by Grover
Cleveland, and who, after making a fine impression
at the Court of <i>St. James</i>—do you know
why it is called that?—returned to his professorship.
He was fond of making general statements,
not only concerned with his specialty, the
law, but on anything that rose to the surface of
his mind; so that to take his course was in itself
a liberal education.</p>

<p>I well remember his beginning one lecture by
saying emphatically, “Trial by jury is a good
thing which has outlived its usefulness.”</p>

<p>I believe that when he made that statement,
he spoke the truth. If it was true then, it is
certainly true now; nothing has happened
since to improve the situation, or to make jury
trials fairer or less expensive to the state. In
America, we have two pieces of obsolete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
machinery—the electoral college and trial by
jury. When I began university teaching, one
of my freshman pupils made the only interesting
contribution to the workings of the electoral
college that I have ever seen. I gave out as
a theme subject, “The Electoral College,” and
the first theme handed in opened with this
sentence—“I do not believe in the Electoral
College.” Well, neither did I, so thus far I
agreed with my pupil; I read the next sentence
to get his reasons; it was the next sentence that
contained the original contribution to the subject,
“The trouble is,” wrote the freshman, “that
in the Electoral College everybody chooses snap
courses.”</p>

<p>Now the original idea on which the scheme
of trial by jury was founded was as good as
human ingenuity could devise. Any person accused
of anything involving legal punishment
was to be tried by a jury of his peers—twelve
average, common-sensible, fair-minded men,
who, after hearing all the evidence and the pleas
of the lawyers, would bring in a verdict, which
presumably would be in accordance with the
facts, and therefore just. But in the course of
time, although human nature has not changed,
circumstances have, and it is difficult to avoid
today the conclusion that the chief qualification<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
for a member of a jury is that he should not be
fit to serve. Unfitness is the only fitness. Anyone
who has an opinion is barred; in order therefore
for one to be eligible he must be one who
knows little of the world in which he lives and
who is curiously insensitive to what everybody
is talking about. In a recent editorial in the
<cite>New Haven Journal-Courier</cite>, the point is well
made.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An intelligent man even with prejudice would appear
to be a better person to entrust the decision of
life or death with, after the presentation of the evidence
and the interpretation of it by counsel and the
judge’s charge, than an ignorant person who knows
too little of current life to form any opinions whatever
upon any subject.</p>
</div>

<p>Furthermore, it frequently happens that after
a trial lasting for months the jury disagree, making
another trial necessary, and involving an
enormous waste of public money. There ought
to be some better way of reaching a decision.</p>

<p>Then the very fact that the members of a jury
are apt to be below rather than above the average
person in intelligence, makes them particularly
susceptible to emotional response when
skilfully handled by a clever criminal lawyer.
Only a short time ago a jealous woman deliberately
murdered her husband and the woman she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
suspected, although neither then nor at any
time were they caught in a compromising situation;
at the trial the evidence certainly looked
black because it was all against the murderess.
She was, however, an attractive physical specimen.
Her lawyer stood her up in front of the
jury, put his arm around her, and defiantly asked
the jury if they were going to put to death this
beautiful woman whose only offence was that
she was a defender of the ideals of the home,
American ideals. Should she, who stood so
nobly and resolutely for family purity, be
slaughtered? The jury acquitted her.</p>

<p>Furthermore, jury verdicts, instead of being
in accordance with the evidence and with the
law, are often determined by local sentiment.
I remember two events in America at the same
time, only in widely separated parts of our country.
In the first instance, a husband who had
for some time suspected his wife, happened to
stumble upon the unmistakable proof of guilt;
in a transport of rage, he killed his man. He
was convicted of murder in the first degree, but
the death sentence was commuted to imprisonment
for life. He is in prison now. In the
second instance, a husband hearing that his wife
had gone to a hotel with another man, deliberately
armed himself, went thither and killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
both. The local jury instantly acquitted him,
and he was a popular hero.</p>

<p>I do not believe in capital punishment, and
should like to see it abolished. But its sole
merit, acting as a deterrent to crime, can be realised
only in a country like England, where trials
are conducted with absolute formality, where a
decision is speedily reached, and where the verdict
of guilty is speedily followed by execution.
In the United States the murderer is too often a
romantic hero, and has a long career as a great
actor, whether or not he is convicted.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the best judges of any
case are those who by education and training are
best qualified to judge. It is significant that in
Connecticut the prisoner may now choose to be
tried by three professional judges rather than by
twelve incompetent men. In a recent famous
instance the prisoner did make that choice.</p>

<p>Too often a public trial by jury becomes a public
scandal; of greater harm to the community
and to the state than the crime of which the
prisoner is accused.</p>

<p>Mark Twain said: “We have a criminal jury
system which is superior to any in the world;
and its efficiency is only marred by the difficulty
of finding twelve men every day who don’t know
anything and can’t read.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_235">XLIII<br>

<span class="subhead">ATHLETICS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The whole world, with the exception of India,
China, Siberia and a few other countries, has
gone wild over athletics. Although new stadiums
and amphitheatres are in process of construction
everywhere, it is impossible to accommodate
the crowds. Millions of people have
apparently the money and the time to devote to
these spectacular contests, and many more millions
“listen in” on the radio. In England last
June Wimbledon was not half large enough to
hold the frantic crowd that wished to see the
tennis matches; the same is true of France. At
a recent wrestling contest in Austria, after all
the seats were taken, the gates were broken
down by the mob of spectators who wished to
enter; about 150,000 people saw a prize fight in
Chicago and it is significant of the times that
the only vacant seats were the cheapest.</p>

<p>Every newspaper devotes an immense amount
of space to sporting news; and all the leading
daily journals employ a highly paid staff of experts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
on sports, who keep the public agog with
excitement before every contest and who endeavour
to satisfy its curiosity after the battle
is over.</p>

<p>Now there are some pessimistic philosophers
who look upon all this athletic fever as a sign of
degeneration, as evidence of the coming eclipse
of civilisation. They point out that during the
decay of the Roman Empire there was a universal
excitement over sports, and they draw the
inference that European and American civilisation
is headed toward disaster.</p>

<p>No one can read the future, although innumerable
fakers are paid for doing so. But it
is at least possible that the ever-growing interest
in athletics, instead of being a sign of degeneration,
is in reality one more proof of the
gradual domination of the world by Anglo-Saxon
language, customs and ideas.</p>

<p>Extreme interest in athletics, though it cannot
be defended on strictly rational grounds, is
not necessarily accompanied by a lack or loss of
interest in intellectual matters. If one had to
name the place and the time when civilisation
reached its climax, one might well name Athens
in the fifth century before Christ. If one compares
Athenian public interest in the tragedies
of Sophocles with New York public interest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
musical comedy, the contrast is not flattering to
American pride. Yet that intellectual fervour
in Athens was accompanied by a tremendous interest
in track athletics. Every Greek city was
a separate state; their only bond of union was
the track meet held every four years and called
the Olympic Games, to which the flower of
youth from every Greek town contributed; and
the winner of each event—a simon-pure amateur,
receiving as prize only a laurel wreath—was
a hero for at least four years.</p>

<p>From the strictly rational point of view it is
impossible to defend or even to explain the universal
ardour over athletics, but it is best to regard
it as a fact, and then see what its causes are.</p>

<p>The majority of Anglo-Saxons have always
had sporting blood, and the Latin races are now
being infused with it. I well remember a train
journey near Chicago during the darkest days of
the World War. We were all awaiting the
newspapers. Suddenly a newsboy entered and
we bought eagerly. The man sitting next to me
was a clergyman in Episcopal uniform. He
looked not at the front part of the paper, but
turned feverishly to the sporting page, which he
read carefully. When I called on the Very
Reverend Dean of Rochester Cathedral, in England,
Dean Hole, I was shown into a room containing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
several thousand books. I glanced over
these and all I saw dealt exclusively with sport.</p>

<p>Many excellent men without sporting blood
have protested against the domination of athletics.
The famous English novelist, Wilkie
Collins, published a novel, <cite>Man and Wife</cite>,
which was a protest against the British love of
sports, in which both athletes and the public
were ridiculed. Why should thousands pay
money to see two men run a race? What difference
did it make to civilisation which man
won?</p>

<p>Yet, although it is easy to overdo excitement
about athletics, the growing interest in sport
which has been so characteristic of France, Germany
and Italy during the last ten years is a
good thing for the youth of these countries and
for their national and international temper.</p>

<p>Years ago, the space occupied in England and
in America by fields devoted to various outdoor
sports was in Germany and France used for public
gardens, where people sat and drank liquor
while listening to a band or watching some
vaudeville. When I first travelled on the Continent,
I found only one tennis court and that
was at Baden-Baden. Today one finds everywhere
in France and Germany tennis courts,
golf links and football fields.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>

<p>It is surely not a change for the worse that a
German student who used to test his physical
endurance by the number of quarts of beer he
could drink at a sitting tests it today in tennis,
rowing and football, and that the French students
with silky beards, who used to strain their
eyes looking at women, now, clean-shaven and
alert, are looking at the tennis ball.</p>

<p>It is, of course, irrational to take an eager interest
in a prize fight, but if you have sporting
blood you cannot help it. My father was an
orthodox Baptist minister. As I had never
heard him mention prize fighting, I supposed he
took no interest in it.</p>

<p>But the day after a famous battle, as I was
reading aloud the newspaper to him, I simply
read the headline, “Corbett Defeats Sullivan,”
and was about to pass on to something important
when my father leaned forward and said earnestly,
“Read it by rounds.”</p>

<span class="subhead">A PRIVATE LIBRARY ALL YOUR OWN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>A borrowed book is like a guest in the house;
it must be treated with punctiliousness, with a
certain considerate formality. You must see
that it sustains no damage; it must not suffer
while under your roof. You cannot leave it
carelessly, you cannot mark it, you cannot turn
down the pages, you cannot use it familiarly.
And then, some day, although this is seldom
done, you really ought to return it.</p>

<p>But your own books belong to you; you treat
them with that affectionate intimacy that annihilates
formality. Books are for use, not for
show; you should own no book that you are
afraid to mark up, or afraid to place on the table,
wide open and face down. A good reason for
marking favourite passages in books is that this
practice enables you to remember more easily
the significant sayings, to refer to them quickly,
and then in later years, it is like visiting a forest
where you once blazed a trail. You have the
pleasure of going over the old ground, and recalling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
both the intellectual scenery and your
own earlier self.</p>

<p>Everyone should begin collecting a private library
in youth; the instinct of private property,
which is fundamental in human beings, can here
be cultivated with every advantage and no evils.
One should have one’s own bookshelves, which
should not have doors, glass windows, or keys;
they should be free and accessible to the hand
as well as to the eye. The best of mural decorations
is books; they are more varied in colour and
appearance than any wall-paper, they are more
attractive in design, and they have the prime advantage
of being separate personalities, so that
if you sit alone in the room in the firelight, you
are surrounded with intimate friends. The
knowledge that they are there in plain view is
both stimulating and refreshing. You do not
have to read them all. Most of my indoor life
is spent in a room containing six thousand books;
and I have a stock answer to the invariable question
that comes from strangers. “Have you
read all of these books?” “Some of them twice.”
This reply is both true and unexpected.</p>

<p>There are of course no friends like living,
breathing, corporeal men and women; my devotion
to reading has never made me a recluse.
How could it? Books are of the people, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
people, for the people. Literature is the immortal
part of history; it is the best and most
enduring part of personality. But book-friends
have this advantage over living friends; you can
enjoy the most truly aristocratic society in the
world whenever you want it. The great dead
are beyond our physical reach, and the great living
are usually almost as inaccessible; as for our
personal friends and acquaintances, you cannot
always see them. Perchance they are asleep,
or away on a journey. But in a private library,
you can at any moment converse with Socrates
or Shakespeare or Carlyle or Dumas or Dickens
or Shaw or Barrie or Galsworthy. And there is
no doubt that in these books you see these men
at their best. They wrote for YOU. They
“laid themselves out,” they did their ultimate
best to entertain you, to make a favourable impression.
You are necessary to them as an audience
is to an actor; only instead of seeing them
masked, you look into their inmost heart of
heart. The “real Charles Dickens” is in his
novels, not in his dressing-room.</p>

<p>Everyone should have a few reference books,
carefully selected, and within reach. I have a
few that I can lay my hands on without leaving
my chair; this is not because I am lazy, but because
I am busy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>One should own an Authorised Version of the
Bible in big type, a good one-volume dictionary,
the one-volume <cite>Index and Epitome</cite> to the <cite>Dictionary
of National Biography</cite>, a one-volume
History of England and another of the United
States, Ryland’s <cite>Chronological Outlines of English
Literature</cite>, Whitcomb’s <cite>Chronological Outlines
of American Literature</cite>, and other works of
reference according to one’s special tastes and
pursuits. These reference books should be, so
far as possible, up to date.</p>

<p>The works of poets, dramatists, novelists, essayists,
historians, should be selected with care,
and should grow in number in one’s private library
from the dawn of youth to the day of
death.</p>

<p>First editions are an expensive luxury, but are
more interesting to the average mind than luxurious
bindings. When you hold in your hand
a first edition of the seventeenth century, you
are reading that book in its proper time-setting;
you are reading it as the author’s contemporaries
read it; maybe your copy was handled by the
author himself. Furthermore, unless you have
paid too much for it, it is usually a good investment;
it increases in value more rapidly than
stocks and shares, and you have the advantage
of using it. It is great fun to search book-catalogues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
with an eye to bargains; it is exciting to
attend an auction sale.</p>

<p>But of course most of us must be content to
buy standard authors, living and dead, in modern
editions. Three qualities are well to bear in
mind. In getting any book, get the complete
edition of that book; not a clipped, or condensed,
or improved or paraphrased version. Second,
always get books in black, clear, readable type.
When you are young, you don’t mind; youth
has the eyes of eagles. But later, you refuse to
submit to the effort—often amounting to pain—involved
in reading small type, and lines set too
close together. Third, get volumes that are
light in weight. It is almost always possible to
secure this inestimable blessing in standard authors.
Some books are so heavy that to read
them is primarily a gymnastic, rather than mental
exercise; and if you travel, and wish to carry
them in your bag or trunk, they are an intolerable
burden. Refuse to submit to this. There
was a time when I could tell, merely by “hefting”
it, whether a book had been printed in England
or in America; but American publishers
have grown in grace, and today many American
books are easy to hold.</p>

<p>Some books must be bought in double column;
but avoid this wherever possible, and buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
such books only when economy makes it necessary
to have the complete works of the author
in one volume. A one-volume Shakespeare is
almost a necessity; but it should be used for
reference, as we use a dictionary, never for reading.
Get Shakespeare in separate volumes, one
play at a time. It is better to have some of an
author’s works in attractive form, than to have
them complete in a cumbrous or ugly shape.</p>

<p>Remember that for the price of one ticket to
an ephemeral entertainment, you can secure a
book that will give strength and pleasure to your
mind all your life. Thus I close by saying two
words to boys and girls, men and women: BUY
BOOKS.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GREATEST COMMON DIVISOR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Some distinguished novelists are like lofty
peaks. Few ascend them and those who do
breathe rarefied air. There are writers whose
fame is apparently secure who have never had
many readers, and there are writers who have
an enormous public and no fame. George Meredith
and Henry James were men of genius, and
there will always be enough people of taste to
save some of their books from oblivion; but
neither of these authors made much money.
Both Meredith and James would have liked to
have a million readers; perhaps it is to their
credit that they made no compromises to increase
the sales of their works, perhaps they
could not have succeeded in such an undertaking
had they tried.</p>

<p>While in the long run it is popularity that determines
a writer’s fame—not only Shakespeare,
but every first rate English poet has today many
thousands of readers—there are also “trashy”
books which sell like gasolene, and there are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
trashy books which do not sell at all. It is a
comforting thought that the majority of trashy
books have a smaller sale than masterpieces, and
that the best book ever written has had, has, and
will have the largest sale of all.</p>

<p>It won’t do to prefer posterity to popularity;
posterity is more cruel to the average writer
than are his contemporaries. Shakespeare was
the most popular Elizabethan dramatist; Ben
Jonson, the foremost press agent of his time,
said that his friend Shakespeare had surpassed
all the writers of Greece and Rome, which was
exactly what John Dryden, the foremost press
agent of his time, said of his contemporary, Milton.
Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite>, Byron’s <cite>Childe Harold</cite>,
Tennyson’s <cite>In Memoriam</cite>, Kipling’s <cite>Recessional</cite>,
were popular two weeks after their publication,
and they are popular now. In the long
run the best books have the largest sales.</p>

<p>In every age, however, there are certain novelists
of prodigious vogue, whose works nevertheless
are to readers of good taste negligible. The
common people read them gladly and the Scribes
and Pharisees regard them with scorn. When
our high school teachers and junior college professors
wish to relieve their systems of accumulated
bile, they pour out before their sceptical
pupils bitter denunciations of Harold Bell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
Wright, the late Gene Stratton Porter and Zane
Grey. They try to persuade their flocks that the
books by these writers are not interesting; but
the flocks know that they are, and instead of despising
these novelists, they lose confidence in
their instructors.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to pretend that Mr. Wright
and Mr. Grey are literary artists, or to enter the
lists as a champion of their works. What I
have read of them has not left me with an insatiable
appetite for more. But here is a fact
of interest to students of books and of human
nature—of the “works” of Porter and of Wright
over nine million copies have been sold, and as
we rate five readers to every copy, each of these
two worthies has an audience of forty-five million
readers. What does this mean? Many
will say it means that the public loves trash. I
don’t believe it; the majority of books are trash,
and the majority of books do not sell. Some
critics and some unsuccessful writers say that
they could write just the same sort of thing if
they would stoop to it; I don’t believe it. The
financial rewards of popularity are so great that
many writers would produce tales of adventure
if they were sure of a million readers.</p>

<p>It is possible that boys and girls read these
books because of their good qualities rather than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
because of their defects. Why is it that these
authors are Greatest Common Divisors? Why
do they make the largest appeal to the largest
number of people?</p>

<p>Well, in the first place they are novelists, and
the foremost of recent novelists, Thomas Hardy,
says that the novel should tell a story. The
average school-boy knows that a book by
Wright, Porter or Grey will have a good story.
The majority of our novelists either will not or
can not tell a story. All they have is a time-plot,
beginning with the smells the baby had in
his cradle, of no interest to any one except the
novelist, going on with his fights and loves at
school, etc., etc. Most people are like the Sultan
in the Arabian Nights, they love a good
story; Wright, Porter and Grey furnish it. The
lives of most boys and girls are not romantic or
unusual; in the novel they get an escape from
life, a change of air, a vacation; and there is
nothing boys love more than a vacation. Again,
however deficient in conduct boys and girls may
be, they instinctively love courage, honour,
truth, beauty, magnanimity; the novels of the
Terrible Three all work for righteousness. In
the eternal conflict between good and evil, these
Greatest Common Divisors are on the right side;
even if they do not know much about style, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
much about psychology, or much about subtlety
of motive, they do know the difference between
right and wrong, something that some much
bepraised novelists seem to have forgotten or to
think unimportant.</p>

<p>I do not believe the majority of supercilious
critics and other cultivated mature readers began
in early youth by reading great books exclusively;
I think they read <cite>Jack Harkaway</cite>, and
<cite>Old Sleuth</cite>, and the works of Oliver Optic and
Horatio Alger. From these enchanters they
learned a thing of importance—the delight of
reading. Once having learned that having
found that a book, easily procurable, is the key
to happy recreation, they obtained a never-failing
resource of happiness.</p>

<p>A similar thing is observable in poetry. If a
boy learns to love highly exciting narrative poetry,
or pretty sentiments set to easy tunes, it is
more probable that he will later love great poetry
than if he never caught the lilt of words in
youth.</p>

<p>Nothing that I have said is at variance with
one of my oft-expressed beliefs—those parents
who are not only interested in the welfare of
their children, but are capable of setting them a
good example, do not need to use the Greatest
Common Divisor so often. They can by sympathetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
intercourse with their children, and by
patience, bring them up from the start on the
Bible, Shakespeare, Bunyan, Swift, Defoe and
other writers of genius; but a large number of
boys and girls come to our schools from uncultivated
homes, and from parents who are stupid,
or selfish, or silly; these children must learn the
magic of books, and it is my belief that the
makers of exciting stories, with sentiment laid
on thick, with heroes and heroines who are
brave, honourable and virtuous are performing a
public service.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE GREAT AMERICAN GAME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Baseball is American in its origin, development
and area. It is also American in its dynamic
qualities of speed and force, and in the
shortness of time required to play a full game
and reach a decision. Americans do not love
serial games like cricket; in literature they are
better at writing short stories than at novels,
and they enjoy games where a verdict is soon
reached.</p>

<p>Looking back over the history of this national
pastime, I can remember when the pitcher was
allowed nine balls before losing his man, and
one year in the last century it took four strikes
to retire the batsman. I can also remember
when a foul ball caught on the first bound was
“out,” when a foul tip—often successfully imitated
by clever catchers—was “out,” and I
played the game many years before an uncaught
foul was a strike. In order to have a wider
radius for fouls, the catcher used to stand far
back, moving up behind the bat only after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
second strike, or when bases had the tenancy of
opponents. Every advance in the rules has
been in the direction of speed; and at present
the game seems unimprovable.</p>

<p>Nearly every game has some inherent defect;
as putting is sixty-five per cent of golf, so pitching
is sixty-five per cent of baseball. Moral:
Be a good putter, and see that your nine has a
good pitcher.</p>

<p>Pitching seems to be a greater physical and
mental strain than in the last century, although
the box artist does not pitch so many balls in
the average game as he used to. In spite of that
fact, Radbourne of Providence, who was the
greatest professional pitcher I ever saw, won
the national championship for his team in 1884
by pitching every day for a long period. And
his team-mate, the late John M. Ward, who
afterwards joined New York, told me that in
1879 he pitched sixty-six consecutive games!
The universal disease of nerves, from which no
twentieth century American is exempt, is probably
responsible for the more careful treatment
of pitchers today.</p>

<p>On July 23, 1884, the Providence club, then
in the National league, was crippled for pitchers.
Radbourne went into the box from that date
until September 26 when he had won the National<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
league pennant, daily, except August 2,
18, 20. He pitched thirty-six games during
that period, twenty-two on consecutive days,
and winning eighteen. Of the thirty-six, he won
thirty-one, lost four, and tied one.</p>

<p>Tim Keefe in 1888 broke Radbourne’s record
for straight games won, by winning nineteen, and
Marquard in 1912 equalled Keefe’s. Next to
Radbourne comes Joe Wood, with sixteen
straight, won in 1912.</p>

<p>Radbourne’s total feat for the 1884 season of
pitching seventy-seven games (seventy-four
National league championships and three world
series, winning three straight in the world series—no
other pitcher was used) is another record
that stands.</p>

<p>The greatest baseball player of all time is
Tyrus Raymond Cobb, of Georgia. He not
only holds an unexampled batting record, his
speed in the outfield was so great that he was
moved from right to centre, and in his base-running
it is not much to say that he raised the
art to a higher plane. Ordinarily, the best of
players was content to steal second, but if Cobb
saw that the ball was not going to beat him to the
second bag, he kept right on to third. The bewildered
second baseman, who naturally had a
psychological caesura when the attempted play<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
failed, had to begin all over again in order to
catch his parting guest at third. And, flustered
as he was by the sheer audacity of the thing, he
was apt to be wild. Cobb capitalised his reputation;
he knew the basemen were all “laying
for him,” and owing to that curse which has always
afflicted humanity, which makes it more
difficult to do a thing in proportion to one’s desire
to do it, they found it more of a task to retire
Cobb than to retire anyone else. If they had
not known it was Cobb, they could have got him.
Mr. Cobb told me once that it was largely a matter
of mind reading; he had to out-guess his opponents,
he had to know what they were going
to do. Certainly his stealing of bases has been
phenomenal; he would steal first base if he
could.</p>

<p>His ambitious, fiery, high-strung disposition,
which is largely responsible for his success, has
also caused him to lose his temper on the field.
This is regrettable, and of course, must be punished.
And yet I have some sympathy for these
lapses, and do not condemn them unqualifiedly
as some colder judges do. The anxiety to win
is what enrages a player when things go wrong,
and I fully understand it though I recognise its
sinfulness. Although I myself was very carefully
brought up by a pious father and mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
and although I had the unspeakable advantage
of being a Yale graduate, I once threw a bat at
an umpire when he called me out on strikes. In
order to atone for this sin, I have often—like
Doctor Johnson—stood unprotected in the rain,
when I had no umbrella.</p>

<p>The greatest baseball pitcher in Yale’s history
was Amos Alonzo Stagg, of the class of 1888.
He won the championship over both Harvard
and Princeton five successive years, pitching in
every championship game. He headed the batting
order, was a fine base-runner, and in minor
games, played behind the bat, on the bases and
in the outfield. He knew baseball thoroughly.
He never had great speed, or wide curves; but
he had marvellous control and a memory that
was uncanny. If a batsman faced him once,
Stagg never forgot him, and thereafter never
gave that batsman anything he wanted.</p>

<p>Carter, of the class of ’95, was a great pitcher
and all-round ball player, as different in other
respects from Stagg as could well be imagined.
Stagg was very short; Carter was six foot four.
Carter had blinding speed with tremendous
curves. But if you compare his record of championships
with that of his predecessor, you will
see why I rate him second to Stagg. These two
men, are, I think, Yale’s foremost box heroes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>Baseball is not so spectacular as football, but
in one respect it has a great advantage over its
more lusty rival. Everyone sees what happens
in baseball; the spectator sees every play, and he
knows instantly the reason for every success and
every failure. In football the ball is concealed
in the line, very few can see exactly what has
happened, and no one knows whether a run or a
touchdown is going to count or not, until the
official has given his consent; and if he withholds
his approval, and the ball is brought back,
the spectators do not know why.</p>

<span class="subhead">TEN SIXTY-SIX</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All persons who speak the English language
should never forget the year 1066, for although
it bloomed and faded long ago, it was an important
event in our lives. In that year William
the Conqueror sailed across the English
Channel, landed on the south coast of England,
and his descendants and those of his party are
there yet.</p>

<p>No wonder the British are proud of their
naval and military history. England is separated
from the continent by only twenty miles;
and yet since 1066 not a single person has got
into England and stayed there without an invitation.
For nearly nine hundred years England
has successfully repelled boarders. Many
able and determined foes devoted all their energies
to realise their heart’s desire. The Spanish
Armada was a grandiose war-fleet, but Sir Francis
Drake and the surface of the Channel that
has made so many tourists seasick, were too
powerful a combination for the gallant Spaniards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
The dream of Napoleon was to invade
and possess England; the nearest he ever got to
it was St. Helena. There is an enormous column
at Boulogne which was erected to “commemorate
the intention of Napoleon to invade
England.” I knew that intentions were often
used as pavingstones in a certain locality; but,
like Browning’s futile lovers in <cite>The Statue and
the Bust</cite>, the immobility of the commemoration
is an ironical commentary. In the World War,
the Central Powers were well-equipped for an
expeditionary force on land, water and air; the
best-selling novel in Germany in 1916 was called
<cite>General Hindenburg’s March into London</cite>, but
it was a work of the imagination.</p>

<p>In reading Tennyson’s play <cite>Harold</cite>, it is interesting
to see that his sympathies are all with the
Saxon king; and it is well to remember that William
could not have conquered England had not
Harold been engaged in a fatal civil war with
his own brother Tostig. Was there ever a more
suicidal folly? When William landed, Harold
was fighting away up in the North in what is now
Yorkshire; and he had to bring his army down
to the South coast through incredibly bad roads,
and there meet the First Soldier of Europe.</p>

<p>However and whatever Tennyson may have
thought, William’s victory was the best thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
that ever happened to England and to those who
now speak English. The battle of Hastings
meant much to Americans. Not only was William
a statesman and law-and-order man, he
made English a world language. By the addition
of the Romance languages to Anglo-Saxon, he
doubled the richness of our vocabulary; English
is a gorgeous hash of Teutonic and Latin
tongues. But William did far more for us than
that. Anglo-Saxon, the language spoken by
Harold in London, is more unlike the language
spoken by King George V than the language of
Virgil in Rome is unlike the language spoken by
Mussolini. Anglo-Saxon is a difficult language,
as difficult for a beginner as German; furthermore,
it is inflected. William, although he did
not know it, made English the universal language,
the clearing-house of human speech in
the twentieth century. It is easier for an American
to learn either French or German than it is
for a German to learn French or a Frenchman to
learn German. Not only are there many words
in English which are like French words, but the
most blessed result of this victory in 1066 was
the eventual simplification of English grammar
and syntax.</p>

<p>If William had not conquered England, it is
probable that today English speech would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
inflexions and grammatical gender. George
Moore says that he dislikes English, it is a lean
language, the adjective does not agree with the
noun—I say, thank Heaven for that! With the
exception of pronunciation, the English language
is ridiculously simple and easy; any foreigner
can learn to write, read and understand
English in a short time, and he can learn to speak
it with fluent inaccuracy. What a blessed thing
for a foreigner who must learn English to know
that when he learns the name of a thing that
name does not change. A book is always a book,
no matter what you do with it. Now, if William
had not conquered England, every time you
did anything to a book, the accursed word would
change. “The book is mine,” but “I take
bookum,” “I go away booke,” “I tear a page out
bookes,” and so on. Then one would have to
discover and remember whether book were masculine,
feminine, or neuter, and every time one
used an adjective, like “good book,” that miserable
adjective would have to agree with the book
in gender, case and number. When one sits
down to dinner in a German hotel, one must remember
that the knife is neuter, the fork is
feminine, and the spoon masculine, and then
one’s troubles have only begun. Remember
what Mark Twain said of German. How simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
to have no case-ending, no gender, and almost no
grammar! No wonder English is becoming the
world-language; it will of course never drive out
other languages, but it has already taken the
place occupied by Latin in the Middle Ages, and
by French in the eighteenth century. A man
can go almost anywhere in the world with English;
and any foreigner who decides to learn one
language besides his own, must choose English.
Anyhow they all do.</p>

<p>The only difficulty with our language is its
pronunciation. Not only are we the only people
in the world who pronounce the vowels a, e, i, as
we do, there are so many exceptions that this
rule does not always apply. One has to learn
the pronunciation of every word. Suppose a
foreigner learns <em>danger</em>, what will he do with
<em>anger</em>? And having finally learned both anger
and danger, what will he do with <em>hanger</em>? I
never met but one foreigner who spoke English
without a trace of accent; that was the late
Professor Beljame, who taught English at the
Sorbonne. He told me that he had practiced
English every day for forty years, and I afterward
discovered that his mother was an Englishwoman.
One day I met a Polish gentleman
who spoke English fluently, but with much accent;
he insisted that he spoke it as well as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
native. I left him alone for three hours with
this sentence:</p>

<p>“Though the tough cough and hiccough
plough me through”; and when I came to hear
him read it, I thought he was going to lose his
mind.</p>

<span class="subhead">GOING ABROAD THE FIRST TIME</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There is no thrill like the first thrill. When
Wilhelm Meister kissed the Countess, Goethe
said they tasted “the topmost sparkling foam on
the freshly poured cup of love,” and Goethe
knew what he was talking about. I shall always
be glad that my first trip to Europe had three
features—I was young; the steamer was small;
we landed at Antwerp.</p>

<p>I was twenty-five and in perfect health; my
head was stuffed with literature, descriptions
and pictures shrieking for verification; my
mates and I rode bicycles across Europe and
over the Alps; we lived with impunity in cheap
inns and on cheap food; we were soaked to the
skin by frequent rains; we were exposed to every
inclemency of the air and to innumerable germs
in rooms, food and water; we were never sick.
We stored away memories which have been paying
daily dividends.</p>

<p>It is not well to wait until one is old, for an
American is, as a rule, never physically comfortable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
in Europe. Unless one is reeking with
cash one is almost always chilly or damp or
hungry or filled with the wrong kind of food.
But Europe has all the things an intelligent
American wants to see, and it is best to see
them when one’s health is rugged enough to rise
above inconveniences.</p>

<p>I am glad I went on a small boat, for I asked a
traveller who recently returned on an enormous
ship if the sea was rough: “I have no idea, I
never saw it.” Our little <i>Waesland</i> had only
one deck, and that was sometimes awash. It
was not a hotel, it was a ship. Finally, instead
of landing at Cherbourg at some unearthly hour,
being transferred to a squeaky lighter, and then
to a train with long hours of travel before one
reached the destination, we steamed up the
Scheldt past the windmills and stepped off the
boat right in the midst of one of the most interesting
cities in the world. The transition from
America to Europe was as dramatic as it could
possibly be, unshaded by tenders and trains.
Thus I advise first-timers to sail either to London
or to Antwerp; you embark at New York
and you disembark at the desired haven.</p>

<p>I love Europe, London, Paris, Munich, Florence,
with inexpressible fervour; but I can never
recapture the first careless rapture. I remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
after that fine first afternoon and evening in
Antwerp, when we walked about in ecstasy in
the rain, we bicycled to Bonn from Cologne, and
that evening before going to bed in the little
Rhenish inn, I looked out from my bedroom
window on the river and on the roofs of the
quaint old town, and I said, “Is it real or is it a
dream?”</p>

<p>The next day was a fulfillment; for when my
classmate, George Pettee, and I were sophomores,
we were sitting in the top gallery of the
theatre watching a picture of the Rhineland put
on the screen by John L. Stoddard. One of us
turned to the other and whispered: “I’ll shake
hands with you on standing on that spot within
seven years.” The answer was, “You’re on!”
We had no money and no prospect of getting
any; but in five years, not seven, we stood on
that identical spot, and as we leaned our bicycles
up against the road wall, we reminded each other
of the night in the gallery. It is pleasant to
dream; but it is pleasanter to make the dream
come true.</p>

<p>The most beautiful country I have ever seen
is England. It has not the majesty of Switzerland,
but it has everything else. Almost exactly
the same size as North Carolina or Michigan,
it has an amazing variety of scenery and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
climate. As one approaches it from the Atlantic,
the cliffs of Cornwall look austere and
forbidding; but there the roses bloom in January.
Stand almost anywhere in Devonshire,
and you see the meadows leaning on the sky;
they are separated from one another not by
stone fences, or by split-rails or barbed wire, but
by hedgerows in self-conscious bloom; Salisbury
Plain is like Western Nebraska, a far horizon;
the misty slopes of the Sussex downs reach
dreamily to the sea. Every few miles in England
the topography changes; could anything
be more different than those different counties?</p>

<p>But we do not go to England for natural scenery,
though we might well do so; we go because
in England every scene is, in the phrase of Henry
James, “peopled with recognitions.” The things
that we have seen in imagination we see in reality;
there they are! The September afternoon
when I bicycled alone to Stoke Poges and saw
the churchyard in the twilight exactly as it was
in 1750 when Gray described it, I fell on my
knees. As we looked from the top of the hill
down into Canterbury, the setting sun glorified
the Cathedral; as we stood on the most solemn
promontory in England, Land’s End, and gazed
into the yeasty waves at the foot of the cliff, I
remembered Tennyson’s lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">One showed an iron coast and angry waves.</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">You seemed to hear them climb and fall</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Beneath the windy wall.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">And here one of the Wesley brothers wrote the
familiar hymn about the narrow neck of land
and the divided seas.</p>

<p>One day, talking with an Englishman on the
train, I raved about Warwickshire and about
Devon. “Ah,” said he, “if you haven’t seen the
valley of the Wye you haven’t seen England.”
Accordingly, we went to the little town of Ross
in the West; there we hired a rowboat, and two
stalwart sons of Britain rowed us many miles
down the stream. Occasionally, the river was
so shallow they poled us over the pebbly bottom;
sometimes it was so narrow we could almost
touch the shores; then it would widen out nobly,
and we saw the white-faced Hereford cattle
feeding in green pastures. “What castle is
that?” I asked, pointing to a ruin on a hill.
“That is Goodrich Castle, sir.” And that is
where Wordsworth met the little girl who knew
her departed brother and sister were alive. We
moved by Monmouth, sacred to Henry V, the
Roosevelt of kings; we came to Tintern Abbey,
and you may be sure we stopped there; whatever
you see, don’t miss the valley of the Wye.</p>

<span class="subhead">SPIRITUAL HEALING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>I believe that the average man or woman today
needs one thing more than he needs anything
else—spiritual healing. I believe this is
truer of the men and women of our age than of
those of any preceding epoch—and I believe they
need it more than they need material luxuries,
increase of mechanical resources, yes, more than
they need mental tonics or emotional inspiration.</p>

<p>The people of the United States are suffering
from “nerves.” Now the casualties in diseases
of the nerves are large, because, as is well known,
in cases of nervous prostration everybody dies
except the patient. I shall not say that America
won the war, but anyhow America was on the
winning side. We were triumphantly victorious;
we are the only rich and prosperous nation
on earth. Americans are the only people in the
world who are physically comfortable in bad
weather. But although there is a steady increase
in physical luxuries, I am not sure of a
steady increase in serene happiness, in the calm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
that comes from mental contentment, in an approach
toward universal peace of mind. What
shall we say of a prosperous and rich nation
whose prosperity and wealth are accompanied
by an epidemic of suicide?</p>

<p>We are overwrought, tense, excited; our casual
conversations are pimpled with adjectives;
our letters are written in italics, and—a sure sign
of fever—there has been an increase in cursing
and swearing. Many respectable persons show
a proficiency in this verbal art that used to be
chiefly characteristic of lumberjacks and longshoremen.
We become colossally excited about
trivial things. Sometimes when I find myself
in a state of almost insane irritation over some
trifle I seem to hear the quiet voice of Emerson
speaking from the grave—Why so hot, little
man?</p>

<p>In a charming comedy by Clare Kummer, in
which that beautiful and accomplished actress
the late Lola Fisher took the leading part, one
of her speeches explained that when she was a
child her mother told her that whenever she felt
herself rising to a boiling point she must stop
for a moment and say aloud, “Be calm, Camilla.”
That was the name of the play, “Be Calm, Camilla”—and
there are many Camillas who need
that relaxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>It is characteristic of the American temperament
that it needs mental sedatives more than
spurs; and yet thousands of Americans are looking
around all the time for something with a
“kick” in it. How often we hear in casual conversation
the phrase, “I got a fearful kick out of
that.” What they need is not a kick, but a poultice;
not a prod, but a cool, healing hand.</p>

<p>Although Americans need healing more than
the men and women of any other nation, there
are times when almost any person would profit
by such treatment. The experience of John
Stuart Mill is not unusual. He was carefully
brought up by his father without religious training.
When he was twenty-five years old he fell
into a state of profound depression. A cloud of
melancholia settled on his mind and heart, so
that he not only lost interest in life but felt that
the world had no meaning. We know that King
Saul was relieved from the evil spirit of nervous
melancholy by music; but Mill loved music, and
yet in his crisis music failed him. Fortunately,
he turned to the poetry of Wordsworth. Now
of all the great poets Wordsworth is the best
healer, because he drew balm from objects within
everybody’s reach. The “Nature” that Wordsworth
writes about does not require a long and
expensive journey, like going South in winter or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
travelling to distant mountains. This poet
wrote about the simple things in nature—the
things that can be seen from the front door or
from the back yard.</p>

<p>The novelist George Gissing, who had been
chronically tortured by two desperate evils,
grinding poverty and ill health, was, owing to a
fortunate circumstance, able to live in solitude
for a time in the charming county of Devon, in
southwest England. The result of his meditations
appeared in a book, first published in 1903,
called <cite>The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft</cite>.
This is a book of healing, and I recommend it to
everybody, for I do not know any one who could
not profit by it. As Mill had suffered from intellectual
depression and been cured by Wordsworth,
so Gissing, who had suffered from poverty
and sickness, cured himself by preserving
the fruit of his communion with nature:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I had stepped into a new life. Between the man
I had been and that which I now became there was a
very notable difference. In a single day I had matured
astonishingly; which means, no doubt, that I
suddenly entered into conscious enjoyment of powers
and sensibilities which had been developing unknown
to me.</p>
</div>

<p>“I had matured astonishingly.” Isn’t that
what is really the matter with us, that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
haven’t grown up? We are like children crying
for the moon, when the riches of the earth are
within our reach. Our pursuit of excitement
and our resultant sufferings are largely childish.
It is unfortunate to suffer from infantile diseases
when we are old.</p>

<p>I have been reading a new novel, a book of
healing, which most new novels are not. It is
curious that so many are eagerly reading new
novels and seeing new plays whose only purpose
is to stimulate animal instincts which need no
stimulation. Or they are reading new novels
which distress and torment a mind already tumultuously
confused. Be calm, Camilla.</p>

<p>The book I allude to was published in 1927.
It is called <cite>Winterwise</cite> and is written by Zephine
Humphrey. It describes a winter spent in a
lonely farmhouse in Vermont, a State not yet
famous as a winter resort—except for those who
think only of winter in connexion with violent
athletics. The book is full of deep, tranquil
wisdom. It points out sources of abiding happiness—happiness
that no disaster can permanently
remove.</p>

<span class="subhead">SUPERSTITION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The best definition of superstition that I can
remember was made by James Russell Lowell—“Superstition,
by which I mean the respecting
of that which we are told to respect rather than
that which is respectable in itself.” Mental
slavery is always degrading; and superstition is
a form of slavery, because the mind is subjected
to fear. As Notoriety is the bastard sister of
Reputation, so Superstition is the bastard sister
of Religion. The difference between the two can
be easily and simply expressed, but it is literally
all the difference in the world. The most elevating
influence known to man is Religion; the
least elevating is Superstition.</p>

<p>The instinctive pessimism of humanity is
shown in many careless phrases such as “It’s too
good to be true.” The majority of men and
women believe that hopes are illusory, but fears
accurately foretell the coming event. Yet any
sensible old man or old woman will tell us that
nearly all the fears and worries from which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
themselves suffered almost daily during a long
life really never materialised. They suffered
for nothing. We learn little from their experience,
but go on our way filled with apprehension
and alarm. Shakespeare said the brave
man dies only once, but cowards die a thousand
times in fearing death. I suppose most of us
are cowards. Although we are still in good
enough health to carry on, we have already died
of cancer, tuberculosis, and many other diseases.</p>

<p>Many social superstitions were cured by that
great turning point in history, the French Revolution.
The world has never been quite the
same since the year 1789. Before that date,
people really believed that those who were born
in noble and royal families were superior to the
common herd; after that date the nobility still
believed it, but the common people did not agree.
They found they had been respecting that which
they had been told to respect, rather than that
which is respectable in itself. A Frenchman remarked,
“The great appear to us great because
we are kneeling—let us rise.” In 1789 everybody
stood up.</p>

<p>It is foolish to respect any person or any institution
unless it is respectable.</p>

<p>The religion of many unenlightened people
seems to be based largely on fear, in which case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
it is of course not religion at all, but rank superstition.
James Whitcomb Riley told me of a
remark made by a small boy to his mother at
bedtime. He jumped into bed, and to the question
of his mother, “What, aren’t you going to
say your prayers?” the child answered, “No, I
ain’t going to say my prayers tonight, and I ain’t
going to say ’em tomorrow night, nor the next
night. And then if nothing happens, I ain’t
ever going to say ’em again.”</p>

<p>This all-too-typical boy looked upon prayer
as a means of warding off danger, and he was
sufficiently intelligent and sufficiently brave to
risk its omission. But if he had been brought up
to believe that prayer is neither a charm against
peril nor a method of getting what you want,
that prayer was intimate communion with a Divine
Friend, he would have looked upon it from
a different point of view. George Meredith told
his son never to ask any material thing from
God, but to pray to Him every day of his life.</p>

<p>Now many men and women have the religious
maturity of a small boy, which is infinitely worse
than having the religion of a little child. They
never pray except when they are in danger, or
when they think they are going into danger, or
when they have suffered from some calamity.
That is like speaking to a friend only when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
want to borrow money. The profound wisdom
of mysticism consists not in making use of God,
but in hoping and believing that God will make
some use of us.</p>

<p>The base-born idea that God is against us is
accompanied by the idea that He may be placated
or humoured. In Richard Halliburton’s
exciting account of his adventures in southern
countries, he tells us how the pagan priests used
to sacrifice thousands of young maidens to their
deity. It would seem, looking back on history,
that the more abominable the religion, the fewer
the atheists. Every sensible person in those
countries ought to have been an atheist.</p>

<p>Now although many “enlightened” people today
laugh at the terrible fears and even more terrible
remedies of those intellectual slaves, they
themselves are not very much wiser. It is highly
probable that the majority of Americans today
would not dare to say “I haven’t had a bad cold
this winter” without touching wood. Some of
them might grin as they touched it, but they
would touch it just the same. Such a gesture is
intellectually and morally contemptible.</p>

<p>But many are even poorer in brains. For
many would not dare to say that they had not
had a cold this winter, with or without wood in
reach. They believe that if you express anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
pleasant, you will soon “get your come-uppance.”
God seems to lie in wait for us, and
the moment we seem satisfied or happy or even
prominent, He will teach us who is running the
show. The best thing therefore is never to appear
too happy. For many, who have been
foolish enough to say aloud, “I haven’t had a
cold this winter,” wake up the next morning
snuffling. “Now you see what I’ve got! If I’d
only had sense enough to keep my mouth shut, I
would have been all right. But of course I had
to brag about it!”</p>

<p>The most degrading of all superstitions is the
belief that God can be placated, appeased, or diverted,
as we humour a refractory boy or a
drunken man. This abominable idea sometimes
takes an extremely tragic form, as when
the Indian mother throws her own baby into the
Ganges. “Now, God, you’ve got to be good to
me! I’ve given you the best thing I had!”</p>

<p>Sometimes it takes a merely silly form, as
when one gives up some pleasant little luxury;
not with the great idea of drawing nearer to God
by removing an obstacle, but with the absurd
idea of bargaining with Him.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE EARTH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Perhaps nothing nowadays is a more common
target for ridicule than the hustler and booster,
whether he boosts as an individual or as a member
of a service organisation. The man whose
motto is “bigger and better business,” a bigger
town, with a bigger population and bigger buildings,
is laughed at for his enthusiasm and for
his perspiring efforts. Much of this laughter is
merely the cynical adverse criticism of men who
have never done anything themselves, never
will do anything, and so pretend to be faintly
and superciliously amused by the optimistic exertions
of others. We may dismiss these unproductive
and complacent occupiers of the seats of
the scornful, for they are comparatively few in
number and their opinions of no moment. But
the rational basis for laughter at the booster is
that the hustler and the booster often have a
false standard of excellence.</p>

<p>When a noisy man roars in your face that the
population of his particular town has doubled in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
ten years we have a right to enquire, what of it?
Is it a cause for rejoicing? When you climb
into a trolley car on a rainy day you do not rejoice
because the population of the trolley car
doubles in three minutes. A mere increase in
the number of persons at a given spot does not
necessarily mean that collectively or individually
they are any better off. What we wish to
know is something quite different from the word
“more.” Is the community growing in intelligence?
Are there better schools, better theatres,
better art museums, better churches,
better orchestras—are the inhabitants of this
locality growing in grace and in the fruits of the
spirit?</p>

<p>The last thing I wish to be guilty of is to make
cheap remarks against science or scientific men
to whom I, in common with others, owe so much;
but, strangely enough, some of the professional
men of science, who are often the first to laugh
at the booster because he applies the quantitative
rather than the qualitative standard of
measurement, are themselves guilty of the same
fault on a larger scale. They do not apply
standards of size to a growing business or a
growing village; they apply these standards to
the universe.</p>

<p>Now, as is well known, the Ptolemaic system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
of cosmogony stated that the earth was the
centre of the universe and that around the earth
revolved the sun, the moon and all the innumerable
stars. Thus man regarded himself as of
high importance because he was the centre of
everything.</p>

<p>Along came Copernicus, whose book was published
in 1543 but not generally accepted until
long after its appearance. Copernicus wrought
a far greater miracle than Joshua. The Old
Testament hero made the sun stand still only for
an afternoon; but in the sixteenth century
Copernicus commanded the sun to stand still
and (relatively speaking) it has not budged
since. Copernicus was a magician.</p>

<p>Many astronomers have recently been fond
of reminding us that our sun itself is only a tiny
star—one out of many billions—and that our
earth is but the tiniest speck. They are fond of
drawing diagrams showing the comparative size
of our sun and that of other globes in the starry
skies, and the earth dwindles to a mere point.
“Therefore,” say these scientists, “how unimportant
is man and how ridiculous that he should
consider either himself or his earthly abode a
matter of any importance to God or to space or
time or gravitation”; the conclusion following
that religion and morals are matters of small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
consequence and we need not bother our heads
about them.</p>

<p>Now it seems to me that expressions of this
kind are as fallacious and as injurious as any
booster’s standard of mere quantity; for what
are these gentlemen trying to say except that as
the earth is so tiny in comparison with other
stars it must necessarily follow that man himself
is a very unimportant factor in the universe?
On the contrary, I believe the earth to be the
most important spot in the entire creation and
that the most precious thing on the earth is
man—men, women and children.</p>

<p>The ordinary ignoramus looks at the starry
vault and exclaims: “There are all those stars
and every one inhabited with life!” As a matter
of fact the latest researches of science show
that the rarest thing in the entire universe is
human life. There is not one vestige of evidence
to show that life exists anywhere except
on the earth.</p>

<p>The universe is frightfully hot. The fixed
stars have a temperature ranging from nearly
two thousand degrees to more than thirty thousand
degrees, which is considerably hotter than
the Needles in California. Furthermore, among
all the heavenly bodies <em>planets</em> are the most
scarce, and the only conditions which can produce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
a planet occur almost never. Now the
planets in our particular little solar system had
the good luck to come into being, and of these
planets only the earth can support human life.
The late Percival Lowell, an eminent astronomer
and a gallant gentleman, looking at the sky
through the clear air of Arizona, thought he
saw evidence of the intelligent work of beings on
Mars, but he saw it because his telescope was
not good enough; “bigger and better” telescopes
destroyed the illusory things he thought he
saw.</p>

<p>I advise all those who believe in the insignificance
of man because he lives on a small ball to
read the last chapter of Sir James Jeans’s book
<cite>The Universe Around Us</cite>. Sir James does not
himself say that man has a divine destiny, because
that is not the subject of his book. But
he does say: “All this suggests that only an infinitesimally
small corner of the universe can
be in the least suited to form an abode of life.”</p>

<p>People used to be flabbergasted by the consideration
of the vastness of the starry heavens
while retaining their respect for man and their
own self-respect; but of late years many astronomers,
by applying the “big and little” method
of measurement, have tried to convince us that
man is of no importance. Thus astronomy, instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
of filling its students with majestic wonder,
fills them with despair. To these scientific
boosters it is the devout and not the undevout
astronomer who is mad.</p>

<p>Fear not, little flock. We are no longer the
geographical centre of the universe, but—so far
as evidence goes—we are the only part of it that
amounts to anything.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHAT SHALL I THINK ABOUT?</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“What shall I think about when I am dying?”
said Turgeney. Well, if I were dying at this
moment, and were fortunate enough to be conscious—for
death is an adventure no one ought
to miss—I should endeavour to compose my
mind and prepare it properly for its next experience.
Then, having made whatever arrangements
were necessary for the welfare of those I
leave, I might—if there were time—review some
of the events of my days on earth from which I
had derived the largest amount of pleasure.</p>

<p>Omitting religion and family life, the two
greatest sources of happiness that I know, which
need no explanation to those familiar with them,
and which no language could possibly explain to
those unacquainted with them, I must honestly
say I have found life good. I would not have
missed it for anything. There have of course
been misfortunes, illnesses, periods of mental
depression, failures, loss of friends, and the general
sense of frustration that afflicts every candid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
mind. But these are shadows, and my life
has mainly been passed in sunshine.</p>

<p>It would of course be very nice to be an immortal
poet or an immortal something-or-other;
to feel the steadfast assurance that one had left
on earth some enduring work that would remain
as a permanent memorial. But although one
knows, as I do, that everything one has done will
be speedily forgotten, I do not see why that
should make one miserable. Why spend one’s
life or even one’s last moments in crying for the
moon? Why not make the best of the good old
world?</p>

<p>That daily life is really good one appreciates
when one wakes from a horrible dream, or when
one takes the first outing after a sickness. Why
not realise it now?</p>

<p>My life has been divided into four parts—Work,
Play, Development, Social Pleasures.
Work is man’s greatest blessing. Whenever it
is in any way possible, every boy and girl should
choose as his life work some occupation which
he would like to do anyhow, even if he does not
need the money. It has always been necessary
for me to work, but if at any time during the last
twenty years some eccentric person had left me
a million dollars, I should have gone right on
working at my chosen professions, teaching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
writing, and public speaking. I enjoy all three.
I enjoy them so much that I have no hesitation
in saying that I enjoy them more than vacations.
There are better teachers, there are better
writers, there are better lecturers; but I doubt if
any of them have enjoyed their work more
than I.</p>

<p>I have also had an enormous amount of fun
out of play. I am a playboy, and shall never
get over it. I like all kinds of games, except
alley-bowling, just as I like all famous music
except that by Meyerbeer. In every game I
have never succeeded in rising above mediocrity;
but here again I doubt if the great players—whom
I nevertheless envy—have enjoyed playing
football, baseball, hockey, tennis, golf, billiards,
pool, duplicate whist—a better game than
bridge—more than I have. If I were now given
the opportunity to spend every single day for
the next five hundred years in an invariable programme
of work all the morning, golf all the afternoon,
and social enjoyment all the evening, I
should accept with alacrity, making only one
stipulation—that at the end of the five hundred
years I should have the privilege of renewal.
And that’s that.</p>

<p>In cultural development, by which I mean the
enrichment of the mind by Nature and by Art, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
have had unspeakable delight. Yet I am neither
a naturalist nor an artist. I don’t know anything
about flowers, and very little about animals.
I cannot draw or paint, or make anything
with my hands. The only musical instrument
I can play is a typewriter.</p>

<p>But no one loves the scenes of nature more
than I. The first sunset that I remember with
enjoyment occurred when I was ten years old;
and how many I have seen since then! On an
autumn day in 1903, I saw the sun sink into the
ocean off the coast of Normandy, and, by the
miracle of memory, I can see it again whenever
I wish. I thought of Browning’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Than by slow, pallid sunsets in autumn, ye watch from the shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At their sad level gaze o’er the ocean—a sun’s slow decline.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I have seen the Matterhorn from the Gorner
Grat, Mont Blanc from Chamonix, and the divine
flush on the summit of the Jungfrau.</p>

<p>Forty years ago I heard for the first time the
Ninth Symphony; and while I have heard it
often since then, the most memorable occasion
was in May 1912 when I heard it at Paris, played
by a magnificent orchestra, conducted by Felix
Weingartner; I have heard <cite lang="de">Die Meistersinger</cite> in
Munich, conducted by Arthur Nikisch; I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
heard the Emperor Concerto, with Ossip Gabrilowitsch
at the piano; I have heard <cite lang="de">Tod und
Verklärung</cite> with Stokowski and the Philadelphia
Orchestra; I have heard De Pachmann (in
his prime) play Chopin’s B flat minor sonata,
Paderewski play Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody
No. 2, Josef Hofmann play Beethoven’s Sonata
111. I have heard <cite>Carmen</cite> sung by Emma
Calvé, Emma Eames, Jean de Reszké and Lassalle;
<cite lang="de">Tristan und Isolde</cite> sung by Jean de Reszké
and Lilli Lehmann; <cite>Faust</cite> sung by Jean and
Edouard de Reszké, Emma Eames, Maurel, and
Scalchi; <cite>Mignon</cite> sung by Mme. Lucrezia Bori;
I have repeatedly heard the three greatest
bassos of modern times, Edouard de Reszké, Pol
Plançon, and Chaliapin.</p>

<p>In the theatre I have seen Edwin Booth as
Shylock, Mansfield as Richard III, Irving in
<cite>The Lyons Mail</cite>, Possart as Mephistopheles,
Sarah Bernhardt as La Tosca, Duse as Francesca,
Salvini as Othello, and twice have I seen
the Passion Play at Oberammergau. All these
are memorable experiences, and for fear I may
not be conscious when I am dying, I am recalling
them now. But if I should attempt to recall
all the glorious things I have seen in nature
and in art, I should have no time for fresh experiences
that await me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span></p>

<p>As for social pleasures, one of the highest enjoyments
is agreeable company and good conversation;
and I especially like men, women and
children.</p>
